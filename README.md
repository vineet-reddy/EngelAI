# SeizureScoreAI: Multi-Agent Clinical Reasoning System

A sophisticated multi-agent system designed to emulate epileptologist decision-making for ILAE outcome scoring after epilepsy surgery. The system uses Large Language Models (LLMs) in a structured pipeline to process clinical notes and determine post-surgical outcomes. **The goal is to teach an LLM to reason like an epileptologist.**

## Overview

SeizureScoreAI employs a three-agent system to process clinical notes and determine ILAE (International League Against Epilepsy) outcome scores:

1. **Clinical Information Extractor**: Analyzes clinical notes to extract key metrics including:
   - Presence of seizure freedom
   - Presence of auras
   - Baseline seizure frequency
   - Post-treatment seizure frequency

2. **ILAE Score Calculator**: Applies expertise to:
   - Process extracted clinical information
   - Calculate ILAE outcome scores based on standard criteria
   - Provide detailed reasoning for score determination

3. **Concise Reporter**: Generates clear, concise explanations of:
   - Final ILAE score
   - Key factors influencing the score
   - Clinical reasoning behind the determination

## Technical Architecture

### Components

- **Frontend**: Streamlit interface for clinical note input and result display
- **Backend**: Multi-agent system using OpenAI APIs
- **Agent Pipeline**: Sequential processing through specialized agents
- **Structured Output**: JSON-formatted data for consistent processing

### Data Flow

1. Clinical note input → Information Extraction
2. Structured data → ILAE Score Calculation
3. Detailed analysis → Concise Reporting
4. Final output → User presentation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vineet-reddy/SeizureScoreAI
   cd SeizureScoreAI
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit/app.py
```

The application will:
1. Accept clinical notes as input
2. Process them through the multi-agent system
3. Return ILAE scores with explanations
4. Provide detailed reasoning for the determination

## ILAE Outcome Scale

The system evaluates surgical outcomes based on the following scale[^1]:
- **Class 1**: Completely seizure free; no auras
- **Class 2**: Only auras; no other seizures
- **Class 3**: 1-3 seizure days per year; ± auras
- **Class 4**: 4 seizure days per year to 50% reduction of baseline seizure days; ± auras
- **Class 5**: Less than 50% reduction of baseline seizure days; ± auras
- **Class 6**: More than 100% increase of baseline seizure days; ± auras

### Testing

The system includes a comprehensive set of **synthetically generated test clinical notes** in the `test_notes/` directory, representing various post-surgical outcomes and clinical scenarios. These notes are designed to simulate real-world inputs but **do not contain any Protected Health Information (PHI)**, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.


## Security Considerations
- The system is **not currently HIPAA compliant**. Users must ensure that input clinical notes do not contain any Protected Health Information (PHI) before using the system.
- API keys are managed through environment variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Streamlit Cloud secrets provide secure deployment

## Limitations

- Requires high-quality clinical notes for accurate scoring
- LLM responses may vary slightly between runs
- System should be used as a support tool, not a replacement for clinical judgment
- Performance depends on the quality and completeness of input clinical notes
