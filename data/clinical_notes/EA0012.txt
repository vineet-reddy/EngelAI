Clinic Date 2/3/18

Dear Dr Jones,

I reviewed this lady with epilepsy in clinic today. The epilepsy seems to be under control on Levetiracetam 1500 mg BD, Zonisamide 150 mg BD, Tegretol 600 mg daily.

I havenâ€™t made any changes and will review her again in nine months time.

Yours sincerely,

Dr Baker
Consultant neurologist
