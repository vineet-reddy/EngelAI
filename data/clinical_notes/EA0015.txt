I reviewed this 36-year-old lady in clinic.  She had a mild sub-arachnoid haemorrhage around 12 years ago.  She continues to get a combination of epileptic and nonepileptic events which was confirmed with an EEG recording.  
 
Currently she is taking Tegretol 500 mg BD and levetiracetam 250 mg BD.  She is also on fluoxetine for depression of 10 mg.
 
I have made no changes to her treatment.  I Will review her in 12 months time.
