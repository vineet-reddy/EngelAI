Dear Dr,

I reviewed this lady with epilepsy in clinic today. I was pleased to hear that she has not had any further generalised tonic clonic seizures since August 2016. There have been no absences since November 2016.

She takes Keppra 500 mg twice a day. She is now four months pregnant. I have not made any changes and will see her again in 12 months time.
