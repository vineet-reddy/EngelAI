Ann Richards. D.O.B. 21/04/1974 

Diagnosis: generalised tonic clonic seizures with myoclonic jerks, possible JME

Anti-convulsant medication: epilim 500 mg BD
Lamictal 100 mg in the morning, 175 mg in the afternoon

I saw Ann who was accompanied with her daughter in my nurse led clinic today. She split up from her partner last year and so underwent a lot of stress. She had approximately 3â€“4 generalised tonic chronic seizures per week from May to August. She also had very frequent myoclonic jerks.

She also has headaches and heartburn. She probably drinks too much alcohol, having around one bottle of wine per day. I have advised her around ifestyle issues and will review her in approximately four months time.
