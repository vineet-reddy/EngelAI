Further to my previous letter, he has had three or four further episodes. They don’t last very long. In some of the episodes there was staring and in some of the other episodes there were falls. Has previously has had one episode during sleep when he woke with a lateral tongue bite. Since the last consultation you have started him on lamotrigine, and this has helped his seizures.
