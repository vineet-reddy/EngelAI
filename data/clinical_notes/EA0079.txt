Dear Dr

Â 
I review Owen without the benefit of his old case notes. His epilepsy started at the age of 3 years. He has nocturnal generalised tonic clonic seizures which are associated with mild learnind difficulties. He has symptomatic epilepsy. EEGs in the past have shown sharpened waveforms in the frontal leads. I do not have the results of his previous brain imaging.

His epilepsy has been stable over the last few years and he gets around 1 generlised tonic clonic seizure in his sleep per month. He has previously tried topiramate and phenytoin and he is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg twice a day and carbamazepine 400mg twice a day.

I suggest that he increases the carbamazepine by 200mg every two weeks until he is taking 600mg twice a day. If there is no improvement in his seizure frequency then we would consider a different anti-convulsant medication. He is not keen on epilepsy surgery at the moment.

As he has been on carbamazepine for a while I will check his bone profile.

Yours
