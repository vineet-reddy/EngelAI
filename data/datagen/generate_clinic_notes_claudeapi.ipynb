    "### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This script generates **synthetic epilepsy surgery clinic notes** using Anthropic's Claude AI API. All notes are created by a **Large Language Model (LLM)** and contain **no Protected Health Information (PHI)**. The example note provided is entirely synthetic and serves as a detailed template for generating new notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**: Loads the Anthropic API key securely from environment variables.\n",
    "2. **Client Initialization**: Establishes the Anthropic client, raising errors if the API key is missing.\n",
    "3. **Synthetic Note Generation**: Uses an LLM to create detailed, professional clinic notes based on a synthetic example, ensuring no real patient data is included.\n",
    "4. **Note Storage**: Saves each generated note as a `.txt` file in a specified directory.\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback for missing keys, API errors, or unexpected issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Ethical Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No PHI**: Both the example clinic note and the generated notes are **entirely synthetic** and contain **no real patient information**.\n",
    "- **For Educational or Research Use**: This script is intended for non-clinical use cases, such as training, research, or simulation tasks where synthetic medical documentation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool provides a secure and ethical approach to generating realistic, detailed medical documentation for non-clinical applications while maintaining compliance with privacy and data protection standards.\n"

    "        Age: 26 years  \n",
    "        Hospital Number: 12345678  \n",
    "        Referring Physician: Dr. Jane Smith, Neurology  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Reason for Review:  \n",
    "        Post-operative follow-up after left anterior temporal lobectomy for drug-resistant epilepsy.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Diagnosis:  \n",
    "        - Pre-surgical: Drug-resistant focal epilepsy with confirmed left temporal lobe seizure onset.  \n",
    "        - Post-surgical: Focal epilepsy, post-resection, seizure-free since January 2023 surgery.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        History:  \n",
    "        Current Antiepileptic Medication:  \n",
    "        Levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily, well-tolerated without side effects.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Previous Antiepileptic Medications:  \n",
    "        - Lamotrigine: Discontinued in 2015 due to rash and inadequate seizure control.  \n",
    "        - Carbamazepine: Discontinued in 2016 due to drowsiness and suboptimal control of seizures.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Pre-Surgical Seizure History:  \n",
    "        - First Seizures (2014): Experienced two generalized tonic-clonic seizures without aura or prodrome. Witnesses noted possible preceding right leg jerking lasting a few seconds. Postictal confusion lasted approximately 20 minutes.  \n",
    "        - \"Absence-like\" Episodes (2014–2022): Weekly episodes of staring and unresponsiveness lasting 5–10 seconds. Mr. Turko was unaware of these events and relied on observations by family and colleagues.  \n",
    "        - Childhood Seizures: Febrile seizures between the ages of 2–4 years, resolved without long-term effects.  \n",
    "        - Family History: No family history of epilepsy, neurological conditions, or febrile seizures. His two children are healthy without seizure activity.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Surgical History:  \n",
    "        - Surgery Date: January 15, 2023.  \n",
    "        - Procedure: Left anterior temporal lobectomy.  \n",
    "        - Intraoperative Findings: Resected area included the left hippocampus and anterior temporal cortex, with pathology confirming hippocampal sclerosis.  \n",
    "        - Post-operative Course: Uncomplicated recovery, with no neurological deficits or infections.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Post-Surgical Seizure Status:  \n",
    "        - Seizure-Free Period: 22 months since surgery.  \n",
    "        - Functional Outcomes: Resumed full-time work as a graphic designer and driving in February 2024 after meeting the seizure-free guidelines.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Investigations:  \n",
    "        Pre-surgical Workup:  \n",
    "        - MRI (2022): Demonstrated left mesial temporal sclerosis with hippocampal atrophy, no other structural abnormalities.  \n",
    "        - Video EEG Monitoring (2022): Recorded five clinical seizures, all with onset in the left temporal lobe. No secondary generalization observed.  \n",
    "        - Neuropsychological Assessment: Mild impairment in verbal memory consistent with left temporal dysfunction.  \n",
    "        - PET Scan (2022): Hypometabolism localized to the left temporal lobe, further supporting focal epilepsy diagnosis.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Post-surgical Investigations:  \n",
    "        - MRI (2023): Post-resection changes in the left anterior temporal lobe without evidence of residual or new pathology.  \n",
    "        - EEG (2023): Normal background activity without epileptiform discharges.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Clinical Assessment:  \n",
    "        Mr. Turko was seen in the epilepsy clinic today for his routine post-surgical follow-up. He reports no seizures, staring spells, or other episodes suggestive of epilepsy since his surgery. He has experienced no medication side effects and feels well overall. He has returned to driving, as well as to full-time work. His sleep quality and mood are good, and he denies symptoms of anxiety or depression.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Neurological examination was unremarkable, with no focal deficits. Cognitive testing in clinic revealed no changes in memory or attention since the pre-surgical neuropsychological assessment. Physical examination, including gait and coordination, was normal.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Discussion and Plan:  \n",
    "        I congratulated Mr. Turko on his excellent post-surgical outcome and discussed the importance of maintaining his current treatment regimen. He was counseled on the ongoing, albeit reduced, risk of seizure recurrence even after successful surgery. The following key points were emphasized:  \n",
    "        1. Long-term continuation of levetiracetam to minimize the risk of recurrence.  \n",
    "        2. Lifestyle modifications, including adequate sleep, regular meals, stress management, and avoiding known triggers such as excessive alcohol.  \n",
    "        3. The rare but serious risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is significantly lower given his seizure freedom.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        We discussed his prognosis, including the likelihood of sustained seizure freedom and potential medication tapering in the distant future if seizure freedom persists. I emphasized the need for close monitoring before any changes are made to his treatment.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Follow-up Plan:  \n",
    "        - Routine follow-up in 12 months, or sooner if symptoms recur or if he has questions.  \n",
    "        - Referral to neuropsychology for repeat cognitive testing in 2025 to assess long-term memory outcomes post-surgery.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "        Mr. Turko expressed his satisfaction with his care and stated he feels optimistic about his quality of life moving forward. He understands he can contact the clinic if needed.  \n",
