The Care Home, Moon Drive, Suntoen. CA33 2JR

I reviewed Mr Gold together with his support worker Ana Harding in clinic today. I was please to hear that the switch from levetiracetam to brivertiracetam has gone well and Mr Goldâ€™s mood has improved. His seizures are also well controlled. 
I will leave him with an open appointment with the epilepsy service.
