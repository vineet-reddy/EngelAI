Dear Dr,
 
I reviewed this 49 year old woman by telephone today. I was pleased to hear that changing the levetiracetam to lamotrigine has helped her mood considerably. She still gets a few panic attacks but in general she is less angry. I understand that the community mental health team are in contact with her about this.
 
Given that she is still having fairly frequent seizures and has no side effects from the lamotrigine Iâ€™d be grateful if you could increase this by 25mg every 2 weeks until she is taking 175mg bd.
 
I have left her with an open appointment here and she can contact us via our epilepsy helpline if there are issues with her epilepsy.
