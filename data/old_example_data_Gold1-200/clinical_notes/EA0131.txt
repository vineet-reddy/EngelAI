Dear Dr,

Re: 	Ms Julie Johilst	31/07/1988

It was nice to meet this 27 year-old woman in clinic again. She has a primary generalised epilepsy with frequent EEG abnormalities. Previous MRI scans in June 2008 and Novemeber 2010 have been normal. 

Her epilepsy was not well controlled on carbamazepine monotherapy. However switching to sodium valproate at 400mg twice a day has made a big difference.

Unfortunately seizures have been worse in the last year. She is having quite a number of generalised tonic clonic seizures which her partner described to me today.

I think the only option here really is to increase the sodium valproate. We did discuss the risks of sodium valproate in pregnancy and in child development and Ms Johilst is well aware of the risks. Howevere this has to be balanced against the risks of frequent convulsive seizures which do carry the risk of serious injury and death.
