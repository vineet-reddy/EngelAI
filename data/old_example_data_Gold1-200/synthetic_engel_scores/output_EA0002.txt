Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient continues to have disabling seizures, including 4 secondary generalized seizures since her last appointment. This indicates there has been no appreciable reduction in her seizures, meeting criteria for an Engel score of IVB (No appreciable change). While she has some focal seizures without impaired awareness, she continues to have generalized convulsive seizures which are disabling. As there has been no worthwhile improvement in her condition, an Engel score of IVB is most appropriate based on the details provided."
}
```

There is no evidence to support alternate Engel scores based on the clinical details given. Even though MRI findings suggest a structural cause that could potentially benefit from surgery, we are assessing her current seizure status rather than future surgical candidacy. Her recent increase in disabling secondary generalized convulsive seizures shows no worthwhile improvement, indicating an Engel score of IVB is most fitting. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
