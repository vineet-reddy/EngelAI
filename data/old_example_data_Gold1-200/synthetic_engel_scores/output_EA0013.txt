Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "4B",
  "reasoning": "The note states that the patient 'continues to get occasional seizures', indicating there has been no appreciable reduction in seizure frequency since the unspecified treatment (possibly surgery). This meets criteria for an Engel score of 4B - No appreciable change. While the note does not provide definitive information about the patient's seizure frequency before vs after treatment, there is no evidence of any worthwhile improvement, which is required for Engel scores of 1, 2, or 3."
}
```

The note lacks some details that would allow assigning an Engel score with complete confidence, but 4B is the best fit based on the information provided. There is no evidence to support alternate Engel scores with valid reasoning. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add regarding the patient's case.
