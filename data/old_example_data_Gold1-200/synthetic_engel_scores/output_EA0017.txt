Based on the information provided, the patient has been seizure-free for around 7 months. As she had been getting 2 seizures per month previously, this represents a worthwhile improvement. However, she has not been seizure-free for at least 2 years, so she does not quite meet the criteria for Engel Class I. 

The most appropriate Engel score is:

```json
{
  "score": "IIIA",
  "reasoning": "The patient has had a worthwhile seizure reduction, going from 2 seizures per month to seizure-free for 7 months. However, she has not been seizure-free for at least 2 years, so does not qualify for Engel Class I. Her improvement fits the criteria for Engel IIIA - worthwhile seizure reduction."
}
```

There is no evidence to support multiple possible scores here. The patient has had a worthwhile seizure reduction that has lasted for 7 months, fitting into Engel IIIA based on the criteria provided.
