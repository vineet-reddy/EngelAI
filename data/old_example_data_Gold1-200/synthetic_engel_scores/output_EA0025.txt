Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of an Engel score for this patient:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient had 3-4 generalised tonic chronic seizures per week from May to August, as well as very frequent myoclonic jerks. This indicates no appreciable change or worthwhile improvement in her seizure frequency or severity (ruling out Engel classes I, II and III). There is no mention of any reduction in seizures, only a high frequency of disabling seizures continuing for several months, meeting criteria for Engel IVB - no appreciable change."
}
```

The note does not mention any periods of seizure freedom or worthwhile improvement in seizure control. So there is only evidence to support assigning an Engel score of IVB based on the information provided, with no other scores being valid possibilities. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
