Based on the information provided, the patient has not had any disabling seizures since increasing her levetiracetam dose. She has only had focal seizures involving left arm movements in the past. The last convulsive seizure was in 2019. She would be classified as Engel class IB ("Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery") on the Engel scale.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has only had non-disabling focal seizures involving left arm movements since increasing her levetiracetam dose. She has not had any disabling seizures since that medication change. This fits the criteria for Engel class IB: 'Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery'." 
}
```

I do not see evidence for multiple possible scores based on the information provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add.
