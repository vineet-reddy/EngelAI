Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IA.

{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "The patient is described as being completely seizure-free for the past 4 years. This meets the criteria for an Engel score of IA, which is defined as 'Completely seizure-free since surgery'. Even though it is not specified whether the patient had surgery, the criteria for IA still applies since the patient has been seizure-free for an extended period exceeding 2 years."
