Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IVB (No appreciable change).

Here is my reasoning:

- The note states that the patient has a diagnosis of non-epileptic attack disorder (dissociative seizures) as well as focal seizures with secondary generalization. This indicates she has a mixed disorder with both epileptic and non-epileptic seizures.

- There is no clear mention of the patient being seizure-free for any prolonged period either before or after surgery. The note mentions she recently had a cluster of seizures requiring hospital admission, indicating ongoing seizure activity rather than seizure freedom.

- While the medication changes led to some subjective improvement in how the patient feels, there is no objective evidence presented of a reduction in seizure frequency, duration or severity. 

- The note states "I think most of her problems are down to the nonepileptic attacks (dissociative seizures)." This suggests the non-epileptic events are the major contributor to her issues rather than the epileptic seizures. However, there is still no evidence of worthwhile improvement in either seizure type.

- Given there is no evidence the patient meets criteria for seizure freedom, worthwhile improvement, or even significant seizure reduction, I would assign an Engel score of IVB - no appreciable change. This indicates her epileptic seizures have not significantly improved with treatment.

In summary, while some medication and dosage changes were made, the information provided does not demonstrate any categorical improvements in seizure control, frequency or severity. Therefore I assigned a score reflecting no worthwhile change has occurred.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has ongoing seizures with no evidence of worthwhile improvement, reduction in frequency/severity, or prolonged seizure freedom. The medication changes provide some subjective improvement but no objective seizure improvement."
