Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IIA (Rare disabling seizures).

My reasoning is:

- The patient has a history of 4 seizure episodes over the past 4 years, which equates to around 1 seizure per year. This frequency would be considered "rare" based on the Engel criteria.

- The seizures are described as episodes of unconsciousness with tongue biting and post-ictal confusion, indicating they are likely disabling seizures.

- The patient was initially seizure-free from age 8 months (after a febrile seizure) until the first event at age 15. She then began having rare disabling seizures, meeting criteria for Engel IIA.

- There is no evidence of seizure freedom for at least 2 years, prolonged seizure free intervals >50% of follow up period, or nocturnal seizures only. So scores of IC, IIIB, or IID would not apply based on the information given.

In summary, the description of around 1 disabling seizure per year, with initial seizure freedom followed by rare seizures, best fits the Engel IIA category of "Rare disabling seizures".

Here is the output in the requested JSON format:

  "score": "IIA",
