Based on the information provided, I would assign Mr. Gold an Engel score of IIB (Rare disabling seizures since surgery).

The reasoning is as follows:

- Mr. Gold continues to have focal seizures with altered awareness that occur about monthly. These are described as being sometimes associated with infections, indicating they can be disabling.

- He also has a history of focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, but has not had one of those seizures in the last 2 years. 

- The IIB category fits his situation best as having rare disabling seizures since the undefined "surgery", with the focal seizures being the disabling ones that occur rarely (monthly).

- None of the other Engel score categories seem to accurately capture his current seizure frequency and impacts. He has more than rare disabling seizures which would exclude IIA. The disabling seizures are not nocturnal only as in IID. And he has not had a worthwhile seizure reduction that has lasted at least 2 years, so IIIB would not apply.

I don't see multiple Engel scores that could reasonably be assigned based on the details provided. So my assessment is:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "Mr. Gold continues to have focal seizures with altered awareness that occur about monthly. These are described as sometimes being disabling. He also has a history of convulsive seizures but has not had one in over 2 years. The IIB category best captures his situation of having rare disabling focal aware seizures since the undefined 'surgery'."
