Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IIB.

The reasoning is as follows:

- The patient has a diagnosis of epilepsy with bilateral convulsive seizures. 
- She initially went 2 years seizure-free after her first event at age 22. This meets criteria for Engel Class IA.
- However, she then began having infrequent seizures, around 1-2 per year. This frequency is described as "rare disabling seizures" which meets criteria for Engel IIB.
- She has these rare seizures despite anti-epileptic medication, meeting IIB criteria of "rare disabling seizures since surgery." In this case "surgery" can be interpreted as initiation of treatment.
- The seizures are described as convulsive bilateral events, which are considered disabling.
- There is no mention of her being seizure-free for at least 2 years since starting medication, so she does not meet criteria for IC, IIA or IIC.

Therefore, based on the available information, Engel IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery" is the most accurate score.

Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has rare (1-2 per year) disabling convulsive bilateral seizures despite treatment with anti-epileptic medication. This meets criteria for Engel score IIB: Rare disabling seizures since surgery."
}
```
