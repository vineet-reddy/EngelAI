Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there is not enough evidence to definitively assign an Engel score. The note states that Mrs. Jones had a single witnessed collapse episode with mild limb jerking, but no further seizure activity before or since the event. The symptoms are more suggestive of a cardiac cause rather than epilepsy. Without a clear epilepsy diagnosis or details on seizure frequency/severity over an extended follow-up period, an Engel score cannot be accurately determined. 

Since an Engel score is specifically for rating outcomes of epilepsy surgery, it does not seem applicable in this case where there has been no surgery and no firm epilepsy diagnosis. The plan does not include neurology follow-up or further investigation into a potential seizure disorder.

Therefore, I would not assign an Engel score here. My reasoning is provided below:

```json
{
  "score": "N/A",
  "reasoning": "There is insufficient evidence of an epilepsy diagnosis or post-surgical follow-up to allow determination of an Engel score. The clinical details provided suggest a cardiac rather than epileptic cause for the collapse episode. Without a clear epilepsy diagnosis requiring treatment or details on extended seizure outcomes, the Engel scale for rating surgical success is not applicable."
}
```

Please let me know if any additional details from the clinical note could clarify whether an Engel score can be assigned. I'm happy to re-assess if more information is available.
