Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IIA",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures ('almost seizure-free') after initially being free of disabling seizures following treatment. Specifically, the notes state that the patient's last generalised tonic clonic seizure was 2 years ago. He continues to have 2-3 absence seizures per day, which are considered non-disabling. Therefore, a classification of IIA ('Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now') is most appropriate."
}
```

There is no evidence to support multiple possible scores here. The patient fits criteria IIA most closely based on the details provided.
