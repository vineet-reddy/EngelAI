Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "The note states that the patient 'has been seizure free since starting antiepileptic medication'. This indicates he has been completely seizure-free since beginning treatment, meeting criteria for Engel score IA."
}
```

The note does not provide any evidence of ongoing seizures or seizure reduction, only that he has been seizure-free. Therefore, I have assigned an Engel score of IA, indicating complete seizure freedom since beginning treatment. There is no evidence to support alternate scores.
