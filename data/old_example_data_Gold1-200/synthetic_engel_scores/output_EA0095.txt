Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is reported to have one to two non-disabling simple partial seizures per day, shortly after waking up. He has no other seizure episodes reported. This frequency and type of seizures fits the criteria for Engel score IB: 'Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery'."  
}
```

The note does not mention the patient having undergone surgery. However, per the instructions, I have ignored that aspect and focused on assigning a score based on the seizure details provided. The seizures are described as "episodes" which occur shortly after waking up, with no mention of loss of consciousness or other disabling effects. This matches the "non-disabling simple partial seizures" criteria of score IB.

The provided details do not fit well with any of the other Engel score criteria, so I have only listed the single chosen score. If additional clinical details were provided that introduced ambiguity or alternate possible scores, I would list those as well with explanations. But with the information given, IB seems the most appropriate score.
