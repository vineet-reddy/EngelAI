Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there are insufficient details to definitively assign an Engel score. The note indicates this is the patient's initial diagnosis and treatment plan, but does not provide any follow-up information on the patient's response to treatment or seizure frequency over time, which is needed to determine an Engel score. 

However, to provide a score as requested, I would assign an Engel score of IVB - No appreciable change.

The reasoning is:

- The patient has a new diagnosis of probable focal onset epilepsy based on the described episodes. 

- He has not yet started treatment with anti-epileptic medication, so there has been no opportunity to assess response to treatment.

- Without follow-up information on his seizure frequency over at least 2 years while on treatment, it is not possible to assign an Engel score reflecting seizure improvement.

- IVB indicates no appreciable change, which fits this initial diagnosis and treatment plan, without indication of improvement or worsening yet.

Formatted in the requested JSON:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has a new diagnosis of probable focal onset epilepsy but has not yet started treatment, so there is no information on response to treatment or seizure frequency over time to assign an Engel score reflecting improvement. IVB indicating no appreciable change fits the lack of follow-up information at this initial diagnosis stage." 
}
```

Let me know if any clarification or additional details on the reasoning would be helpful!
