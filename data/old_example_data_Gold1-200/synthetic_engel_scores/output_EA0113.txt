Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since the initial onset several years ago. Specifically, he has had on average one seizure per year since age 16, with a total of 3 seizures in 2018. These seizures involve generalized convulsions with stiffening, shaking, breathing changes, and prolonged postictal states. While not completely seizure-free, this pattern of infrequent generalized convulsions fits the criteria for Engel score IIB - Rare disabling seizures since surgery."
}
```

The patient does not qualify for Engel class I since he continues to have some disabling seizures. Classes III and IV also do not apply since he has experienced a worthwhile reduction in seizures compared to the initial onset, rather than no worthwhile improvement. 

Within class II, score IIA does not apply because he was not initially seizure-free. Score IIC also does not apply because he has not had seizure freedom for at least 2 years. Scores IID and IIE do not match his seizure semiology. Therefore, based on the occurrence of rare disabling generalized convulsions since the initial diagnosis, score IIB is the best fit.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
