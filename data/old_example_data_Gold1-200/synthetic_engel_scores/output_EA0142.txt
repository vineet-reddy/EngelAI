Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been completely seizure-free since February 6th. This amounts to almost 5 months of seizure freedom as of the clinic date on June 3rd. While not yet 2 full years, this represents a significant improvement and he is only experiencing non-disabling simple partial seizures at this point. This meets criteria for an Engel score of IB."
}
```

The note does not provide information to suggest any other possible scores. The patient was previously having disabling seizures around 3 times per month. He is now seizure-free for almost 5 months, meeting criteria for score IB based on the scale definitions.
