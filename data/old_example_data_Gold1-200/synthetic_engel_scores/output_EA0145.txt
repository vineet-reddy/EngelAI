Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IIB.

My reasoning is:

- The patient has epilepsy with two types of seizures: blank episodes occurring at least once per day, and grand mal seizures occurring a few times per month. Both seizure types appear to be disabling based on their frequency and effects described.

- The patient has tried multiple anti-seizure medications in the past with adverse effects or lack of efficacy. Her current medications of clobazam and lamotrigine have reduced but not eliminated her disabling seizures. 

- She continues to have rare disabling grand mal seizures a few times per month despite medications. This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery".

- While she has daily blank episodes, these could potentially qualify as non-disabling simple partial seizures (Engel IB). However, the information provided indicates they are disabling based on frequency, duration, and loss of awareness.

As there is only one clear Engel score based on the details provided, I have not included other possible classifications or reasons. If further information becomes available, other scores may be applicable.

Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has rare disabling grand mal seizures a few times per month despite medications. This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'."
}
```

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to provide.
