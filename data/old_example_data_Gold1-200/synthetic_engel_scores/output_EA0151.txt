Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient had a cluster of 5 seizures within a 2 day period last month. This indicates that she is having rare disabling seizures since starting treatment (lamotrigine). While she has periods of seizure control, the recent cluster of disabling seizures meets criteria for Engel IIB - Rare disabling seizures since surgery."
}
```

The clinical note does not provide enough information to determine if there are multiple possible Engel scores for this patient. There is no mention of the patient having surgery, so the only applicable categories are related to seizures since starting medication treatment. Based on the information provided, IIB appears to be the most appropriate score.
