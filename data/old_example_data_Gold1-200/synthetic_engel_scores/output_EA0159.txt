Based on the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score and reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "1D",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been seizure-free for 6 months, indicating she is free of disabling seizures. The note mentions she sometimes forgets to take her anti-epileptic medication lamotrigine, but does not state she has had seizures as a result. Her main issues currently appear to be anxiety-related symptoms like absences and non-epileptic attacks. Therefore, the criteria for Engel class 1D - 'Generalized convulsions with antiepileptic drug withdrawal only' seems most applicable, as she is currently seizure-free but could be at risk for seizures if she stops her medication completely."
}
```

The note does not provide enough information to determine if there are multiple possible Engel scores for this patient. Only one score with reasoning is provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
