Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "The note states that the patient 'remains seizure free', indicating she has been completely seizure-free since some unspecified past treatment or intervention. This satisfies the criteria for an Engel score of IA (Completely seizure-free since surgery). Though it's unclear if she has had surgery, the instructions said to ignore that for determining the score. The lack of any reported seizures means classes II through IV would not apply."  
}
```

The note does not provide enough conflicting information to reasonably justify multiple Engel scores. It clearly states she "remains seizure free", meeting the IA criteria of being completely seizure-free over an undefined period. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
