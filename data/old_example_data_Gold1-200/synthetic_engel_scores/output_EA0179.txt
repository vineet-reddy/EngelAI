Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the clinical note to definitively assign an Engel score. The note states that the patient has a history of seizures as a child and was previously on anti-seizure medication, but there are no details provided about his current seizure frequency or response to medication. 

The note mentions he has recently been started on sodium valproate which has stopped his episodes of loss of consciousness, but it is unclear if these episodes represent seizures or some other condition like syncope. There is also mention of an abnormal EEG in the past, but no results from recent EEG testing are provided.

Without further details on his current seizure frequency, duration of seizure freedom, or response to medication, I do not feel comfortable assigning a definitive Engel score. The information provided simply does not contain the necessary criteria outlined in the Engel scale.

However, here is my best attempt at possibilities based on the limited info:

```json
{
  "score": ["IA", "IB", "IIA", "IIB"],
  "reasoning": "He was started on an anti-seizure medication which stopped his episodes, suggesting he may now be seizure-free (IA). However, if the episodes were syncope rather than seizures, he may still have some non-disabling simple partial seizures (IB). There is also not enough follow-up information to confirm sustained seizure freedom over at least 2 years. If the episodes were confirmed seizures, he could have either been initially seizure-free but now has rare seizures (IIA) or rare seizures since starting medication (IIB)." 
}
```

I would need more information about his current seizure status, EEG results, and duration of follow-up before being able to definitively classify him. But hopefully this illustrates my reasoning for the possibilities based on the limited data provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add.
