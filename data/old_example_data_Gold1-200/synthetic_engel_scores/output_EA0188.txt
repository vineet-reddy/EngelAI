Based on the information provided, this patient would best fit into Engel class IIIA (Worthwhile seizure reduction).

Here is the reasoning:

- The patient is having around 1 seizure per day currently. She also has more severe secondary generalized seizures about once per month. This frequency of disabling seizures does not qualify her for class I (free of disabling seizures) or class II (rare disabling seizures).

- There is no clear evidence that she has had prolonged seizure-free intervals amounting to greater than half the follow-up period to qualify for class IIIB. 

- While she continues to have frequent daily seizures, it seems they are less severe focal onset seizures, with only about 1 generalized convulsive seizure per month. This suggests there has been worthwhile improvement and reduction in severity compared to her baseline, meeting criteria for class IIIA.

- There is no evidence to determine if she has had no appreciable change (class IVB) or if seizures are worse (class IVC) to qualify her for class IV.

In summary, her seizure frequency and pattern are most consistent with Engel class IIIA based on the details provided.
