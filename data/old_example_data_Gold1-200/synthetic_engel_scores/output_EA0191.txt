Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IA.

{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "The clinical note states that the patient has had 'no further seizures since her surgery', indicating she has been completely seizure-free since undergoing surgery. This meets the criteria for an Engel score of IA: 'Completely seizure-free since surgery'."
}

There is no evidence to support alternate scores, as the patient is documented to be completely seizure-free with no mentions of ongoing seizures of any kind. The note is focused on improvements in other areas of functioning such as mood and interest in driving/hobbies. Therefore, I have provided only the single Engel score of IA with reasoning.
