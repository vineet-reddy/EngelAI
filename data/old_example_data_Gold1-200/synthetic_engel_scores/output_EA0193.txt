Based on the information provided, there is not enough detail to definitively assign an Engel score. The note states that the patient has bilateral convulsive seizures, with the last reported event on June 3, 2007. It also mentions additional "blank" events, which are unclear. 

There has been no clear statement regarding the patient's seizure frequency or level of control in the time since the last reported event. As a result, multiple Engel scores could potentially apply here:

```json
{
  "score": "1B",
  "reasoning": "The patient could be considered seizure-free aside from non-disabling simple partial seizures ('blank' events). However, without more detail it is unclear if these events are truly simple partial or disabling."
},
{
  "score": "1C", 
  "reasoning": "The patient may have had some disabling seizures after surgery, but has now been free of disabling seizures for over 2 years, meeting criteria for 1C."
},
{
  "score": "2B",
  "reasoning": "The patient could also be having rare disabling seizures currently, meeting criteria for 2B."  
}
```

More detail is needed regarding the patient's seizure frequency, type, and impact over the last 2+ years in order to definitively categorize them based on the Engel criteria. But based on the limited information provided, scores of 1B, 1C, or 2B seem most plausible.
