Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IIB (Rare disabling seizures since surgery).

Here is my reasoning:

- The patient is experiencing focal dyscognitive seizures 2-3 times per week. These would be considered disabling seizures.
- She is also having 1-2 focal to bilateral convulsive seizures per year. These would also be considered disabling.
- The seizures are not completely controlled, but they are relatively rare (a few per week and a couple per year).
- There is no mention of the patient having surgery, so criteria related to post-surgical outcomes do not directly apply. However, IIB indicates rare disabling seizures in general, not specifically after surgery.

Therefore, IIB appears to be the best fit based on the seizure frequency described. There is no evidence to support a score of IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIC, IID, IIIA, IIIB, IVA, or IVC based on the information provided.

My response in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing focal dyscognitive seizures 2-3 times per week and 1-2 focal to bilateral convulsive seizures per year. These qualify as disabling seizures occurring relatively rarely, meeting criteria for score IIB."
}
```

Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to add regarding the patient's case. I'm happy to reassess my scoring if provided with more comprehensive information.
