Based on the information provided, there is not enough detail to definitively assign an Engel score. The note mentions the patient has been having around one seizure per month, but then an increase in frequency since April to several per week. However, it is unclear over what timeframe "several per week" refers to. Additionally, the note mentions the possibility that some of the episodes may be non-epileptic in nature.

Without more specifics on seizure frequency over defined time periods, it is difficult to determine if the patient meets criteria for worthwhile seizure reduction (IIIA) or rare disabling seizures (IIB). The lack of clarity around episode type also complicates classification.

Given these limitations, here are two possible scores with reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "IIIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient could potentially meet criteria for IIIB given the prolonged seizure-free intervals amounting to greater than half the follow-up period if the timeframe of increased seizures is limited. However, the specifics required to make this determination are not provided."
}

{
  "score": "IVB", 
  "reasoning": "Without clear information on seizure frequency and type over specified timeframes, the limited details provided could also fit IVB criteria of no appreciable change."
}
```

In summary, the lack of specifics prevents a definitive single Engel score assignment. Providing additional details on timeframe, seizure counts, and event characterization would allow for a more accurate classification.
