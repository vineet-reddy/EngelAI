Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is having generalized seizures every 2 months. This frequency of disabling seizures would be considered 'rare' based on the Engel criteria. She has had this frequency of seizures since they reappeared 5 years ago. Therefore, she meets criteria for an Engel IIB classification - rare disabling seizures since surgery/treatment." 
}

```

The patient does not meet criteria for Engel IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIC, IID, IIIA, IIIB, IVA, or IVC based on the information provided. There is only one clear Engel classification that matches her situation based on the note. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
