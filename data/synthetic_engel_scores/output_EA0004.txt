Based on the information provided, there are a few possibilities for this patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The note states the patient is having 'several seizures' since his last appointment, indicating his seizures are not well-controlled. However, there is not enough information to determine if there has been 'no appreciable change' (IVB) in seizure frequency compared to his baseline, or if his seizures are 'worse' (IVC). Without a clear baseline for comparison, IVB appears most appropriate."
}
```

Since there is uncertainty around the patient's exact seizure frequency and how that compares to his baseline, other possible scores include:

```json 
{
  "score": "IVC", 
  "reasoning": "If his current seizure frequency reflects a worsening from his previous baseline, an Engel score of IVC ('Seizures worse') could also be justified."
}
```

Or

```json
{
  "score": "IIIB",
  "reasoning": "If he has prolonged seizure-free intervals amounting to greater than half the follow-up period but at least 2 years, a score of IIIB could potentially apply. However, the information provided does not clearly support this." 
}
```

In summary, IVB appears most appropriate based on the note, but other scores could potentially apply depending on additional details not provided.
