Based on the clinical note, here is the assessment using the Engel Outcome Scale criteria:

```json
{
  "score": "1A",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been completely seizure-free since 2014 when he had 2 generalised tonic clonic seizures and some absence-like episodes. He has not had any seizures or concerning episodes since then, so he meets criteria for Class 1A - completely seizure-free since the seizure events in 2014."
}
```

The note states that the patient "remains seizure free and is now driving". There is no mention of any seizures or concerning episodes since 2014. Therefore, Class 1A - "Completely seizure-free since surgery" (substituted here as "since seizure events") - is most applicable.

There are no other Engel scores that seem reasonably justified based on the information provided. The patient has been seizure-free for over 2 years with no mention of recurring seizures, meeting Class 1A criteria.
