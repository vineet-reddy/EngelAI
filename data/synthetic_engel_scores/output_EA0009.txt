Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score and reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing disabling seizures at a frequency of 2-4 per month on average, with a past cluster of 6-9 seizures per week for a 3 week period. This indicates there has been no appreciable reduction in seizures compared to her pre-operative state, which is criteria for an Engel score of IVB. While she does have some periods of seizure freedom in between clusters, these do not amount to greater than half the follow-up period or at least 2 years, which would be required for an Engel score of IIIB."
}
```

The patient does not meet criteria for any other Engel score based on the information provided. She has frequent ongoing disabling seizures without worthwhile improvement, so IVB is the appropriate score. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
