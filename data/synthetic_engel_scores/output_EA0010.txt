Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of ID.

The reasoning is as follows:

- The patient has a history of focal to bilateral convulsive seizures in his teenage years, indicating a past history of disabling seizures. 

- He has been seizure-free since being on lamotrigine 150mg twice daily. The clinical note states "Things are quite stable from an epilepsy point of view".

- This meets criteria for Engel class ID: "Generalized convulsions with antiepileptic drug withdrawal only". The patient had generalized convulsions in the past, but is now seizure-free on anti-epileptic medication.

Therefore, the Engel score I would assign is:

```json
{
  "score": "ID",
  "reasoning": "The patient has a history of focal to bilateral convulsive seizures in his teenage years that have since been controlled with anti-epileptic medication lamotrigine 150mg twice daily. He meets criteria for Engel class ID based on his history of disabling seizures now controlled with medication."
}
```

There is no evidence to support alternate Engel scores based on the information provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
