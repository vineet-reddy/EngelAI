Based on the information provided, the patient has focal seizures with altered awareness approximately once every 2 weeks (1 per fortnight). He also has rare focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, with his last one around Christmas 2017. He is on two anti-epileptic medications (eslicarbazepine and zonisamide).

Given the seizure frequency and type, the most appropriate Engel score for this patient is:

```json
{
  "score": "2B",
  "reasoning": "The patient has rare disabling (convulsive) seizures since surgery or treatment, meeting criteria for Engel score IIB. He has focal seizures more frequently, but these are not characterized as disabling. The last convulsive seizure was around Christmas 2017, indicating less than 1 per year, which qualifies as rare."
}
```

There is no evidence to support another valid score based on the information provided. The patient does not meet criteria for seizure freedom or worthwhile seizure reduction at this time. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add.
