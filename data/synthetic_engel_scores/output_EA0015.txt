Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there are not enough details to definitively assign an Engel score. The note states that the patient continues to have a combination of epileptic and nonepileptic events, but does not quantify the frequency or severity of the epileptic seizures. Additionally, there is no clear follow-up period provided to evaluate the patient's seizure control over time. 

However, here is my best attempt at assigning an Engel score with the limited information:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient continues to have unspecified epileptic seizures despite antiepileptic medication, indicating there has been no appreciable change or worthwhile improvement in seizure control (Class IV). More specifics on seizure frequency, severity, and temporal pattern are needed to further characterize the level of seizure control."
}
```

Without further details on the patient's seizures, there is not enough evidence to justify assigning a more favorable Engel class. However, if more information was provided showing a significant reduction in disabling seizures, a Class III or II score could also potentially apply. But with the information given, Class IVB indicating no worthwhile improvement seems most appropriate.
