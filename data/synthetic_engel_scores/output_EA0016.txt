Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IID",
  "reasoning": "The patient had a single focal seizure likely related to his previous stroke. He has not had any seizures prior to this event. The seizure was focal in nature, involving shaking of the right arm and some lip smacking, without generalization. This would be classified as a nocturnal seizure under the Engel criteria. While not explicitly stated, the description of the event occurring while sitting on the sofa implies the seizure happened at a time when the patient would normally be awake and active, meeting the nocturnal classification. With only a single seizure occurring so far, there is no evidence of rare or frequent disabling seizures, worthwhile improvement, or worsening at this time. Therefore, the score of IID - Nocturnal seizures only, is most applicable."
}
```

There is only one score that fits the limited information provided in this initial presentation. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional clinical details to share that could change the scoring.
