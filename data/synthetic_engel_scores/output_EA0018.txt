Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is currently experiencing focal seizures with an unusual thought sensation occurring around twice per week. These seizures are not fully controlled with medication, indicating that the patient has rare disabling seizures since the unspecified treatment, meeting criteria for Engel IIB. While the seizures were previously more frequent and of a different semiology (visual occipital lobe seizures), the note does not provide enough information to determine if those seizures have completely resolved or just reduced in frequency. Overall, the description of current seizures occurring around twice weekly with unchanged medications aligns closest with an Engel IIB classification."
}
```

There is not enough information provided to justify alternate Engel scores with valid reasoning. The patient clearly continues to have recurring focal seizures, ruling out Class I. There is no mention of a reduction in seizures over an extended timeframe, ruling out Class III. And there is no mention of seizures worsening, ruling out Class IV. Therefore, I have provided only the single Engel IIB score based on the rare disabling seizures present currently. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to add regarding the patient's seizure status over time.
