Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been free of disabling seizures since August 2016, meeting criteria for Class I. She continues to have non-disabling simple partial seizures, fitting the IB designation of 'Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery'. While it is not stated she had surgery, the criteria still fit her situation of being free of disabling seizures but continuing non-disabling partial seizures."
}
```

The patient has been seizure-free of disabling generalised tonic-clonic seizures since August 2016 and free of absence seizures since November 2016, indicating a period of over 2 years free of disabling seizures. This meets the Class I criteria of being free of disabling seizures. 

She continues to have non-disabling simple partial seizures, fitting the IB subclassification of "Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery." While it is not stated she had surgery, the criteria still apply to her situation.

There is no evidence of multiple possible scores based on the information provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
