Based on the information provided, there is not enough evidence to conclusively assign an Engel score. The note does not clearly state the patient's seizure frequency before or after treatment. However, here is my assessment:

{
  "score": "IIIA",
  "reasoning": "The patient is described as 'doing very well' on medication, with no side effects. This suggests worthwhile improvement in seizures. However, without more details on the specific seizure frequency and type, it is difficult to assign a more specific Engel class."
}

Since there is limited information provided in the clinical note, there could potentially be other valid scores depending on the missing details. But with the details given, IIIA seems most appropriate.
