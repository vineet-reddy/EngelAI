Based on the clinical note, here is the assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and is on two anti-epileptic medications - Epilim and Clobazam. The note states that the patient's epilepsy is well-controlled on the medications, except for a recent breakthrough seizure that was triggered by sleep deprivation. The patient continues to have occasional myoclonic jerks, but these are described as not troublesome. 

Based on this information, the patient would be assigned an Engel score of IB - 'Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery'. While the patient has not undergone surgery, the criteria fits as the patient only has occasional non-disabling myoclonic jerks at this time, which would be equivalent to simple partial seizures."
}
