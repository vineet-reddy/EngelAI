Based on the information provided, there is not enough evidence to definitively assign an Engel score. The note states that the patient has a history of childhood onset epilepsy that has generally been well-controlled, with a convulsive seizure about every 5 years. He has recently developed new events that sound more syncopal in nature. However, there are no details provided regarding the frequency or disabling nature of any recent seizures.

Without further information, here are the possible Engel scores and reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB", 
  "reasoning": "This score indicates no appreciable change compared to his baseline seizure frequency. His longstanding epilepsy has been well-controlled in the past despite infrequent convulsive seizures. The information provided does not indicate any clear change in seizure frequency recently."
}
```

Or

```json
{
  "score": "IIIB",
  "reasoning": "This score indicates worthwhile seizure reduction with prolonged seizure-free intervals amounting to greater than half the follow-up period. It is unclear if he has had any convulsive seizures in the past 2 years, so this reasoning is more speculative."
}
```

In summary, there is insufficient information to definitively assign an Engel score. Additional details would be needed regarding his recent seizure frequency, type, and disability level in order to accurately categorize based on the Engel criteria.
