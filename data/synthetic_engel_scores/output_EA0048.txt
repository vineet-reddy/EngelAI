Based on the information provided, here is my assessment of an appropriate Engel score for this patient:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling tonic-clonic seizures, occurring about once every 3 weeks recently. This fits the criteria for an Engel score of IIB: 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. While the frequency and severity could potentially also meet the criteria for IIA ('Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now'), there is no information provided to suggest the patient was ever free of disabling seizures after some intervention. Therefore, IIB appears to be the most appropriate score based on the details given."
}
```

There is only one score that seems to clearly match the details provided on the patient's seizure frequency and severity. However, if additional relevant information was provided that supported an alternative score, I would be happy to reassess and provide any other potential Engel scores with reasoning. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to share.
