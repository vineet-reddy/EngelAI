Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since the onset of his epilepsy. Specifically, the note states that he normally has around 2-3 seizures per month. While not explicitly stated, these seizures appear to be disabling based on the description of impairment of awareness and inability to respond properly. He has not had any prolonged seizure-free periods. Therefore, an Engel score of IIB ('Rare disabling seizures since surgery') seems most appropriate."
}
```

The note does not provide enough information to confidently assign any other Engel scores. The patient does not seem to fit criteria for scores IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIC, IID, IIIA, IIIB, IVA, or IVC based on the information provided.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
