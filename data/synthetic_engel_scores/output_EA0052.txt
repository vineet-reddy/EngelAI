Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is having rare disabling seizures since surgery. Specifically, the note states that the patient has had 4 more attacks since the last appointment. While the exact timeframe is not provided, this still indicates the patient is having rare disabling seizures. There is no mention of the patient being seizure-free for any prolonged period of time. Therefore, an Engel score of IIB - 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery' is the most appropriate based on the details provided."
}
```

There is not enough information provided to determine if any other Engel scores may be valid for this patient. The note does not give specifics on the patient's seizure frequency and control prior to or immediately after surgery. As such, I have provided only the single most appropriate score based on the details given. If any further clinical details are available that could support alternate scores, please provide them for additional analysis.
