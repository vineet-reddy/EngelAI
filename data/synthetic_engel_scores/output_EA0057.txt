Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has symptomatic structural epilepsy secondary to a previous cerebral abscess and surgery. He used to have monthly focal motor seizures without changes in awareness (simple partial seizures) involving his left arm, but has not had these types of seizures for around two years. He also used to have focal to bilateral convulsive (generalized tonic-clonic) seizures, with his last one being on Christmas day 2009. Currently, his main issue is dissociative seizures occurring around twice weekly. 

Based on this history, the patient has had rare disabling seizures (generalized convulsions) since surgery, meeting criteria for Engel IIB. He previously had disabling seizures, but they have become rare over the last 2+ years. The dissociative seizures are not considered epileptic seizures for Engel scoring. Therefore, IIB appears to be the most applicable score."
}
```

In this case, there does not appear to be evidence for multiple possible Engel scores based on the information provided. The patient has achieved rare disabling seizures status after initially having more frequent seizures following his surgery. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
