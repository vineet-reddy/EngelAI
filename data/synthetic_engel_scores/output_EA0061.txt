Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IC.

My reasoning is as follows:

- The patient has focal seizures with altered awareness, with his last event being 3 years ago. This meets the criteria for "some disabling seizures after surgery" as per the IC definition.

- He has also had 2 focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures in the past, but his last event was 10 years ago. This further supports him having some disabling seizures after an unspecified surgery, but being free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years as required for an IC classification.

- There is no mention of him having undergone actual surgery in the note. However, the instructions state to assign a score regardless of surgery status. 

- No other Engel scores seem to accurately capture his seizure status based on the information provided. An IC classification appears most fitting.

Therefore, my assessment is:

```json
{
  "score": "IC",
  "reasoning": "The patient has had some disabling focal onset seizures after an unspecified surgery, but has been free of disabling seizures for over 2 years, meeting criteria for an Engel score of IC."
}
```

I do not see evidence to support any other potential scores based on the details in the clinical note. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
