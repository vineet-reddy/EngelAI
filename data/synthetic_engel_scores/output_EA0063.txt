Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been seizure-free for 5 months since reaching her current dose of lamotrigine. This indicates she is having non-disabling simple partial seizures only since starting medication. While not completely seizure-free, she has not had any disabling seizures in the past 5 months. This fits the criteria for Engel score IB."
}
```

The note does not mention any other seizure types or provide enough information to justify an alternative Engel score. As there is only one clear score based on the details given, I have not included any score variations. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
