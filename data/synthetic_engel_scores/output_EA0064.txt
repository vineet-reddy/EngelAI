Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IB.

Here is my analysis:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is reported to have 'infrequent seizures, maybe twice a year'. This indicates that the patient continues to have some seizures, but they are described as infrequent and there is no mention of them being disabling. An Engel score of IB corresponds to 'Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery'. Although it is not specified whether these seizures are simple partial, the lack of mention of disabling seizures matches the IB criteria. The seizures are also described as infrequent, rather than rare, which fits better with IB than IIA or IIB. Therefore, I have assigned a score of IB based on the available information."
}
```

There is no clear evidence for alternate scores based on the details provided. If more information was available about whether the seizures were disabling or simple partial, this could potentially change the score. But with the current information, IB seems most appropriate.
