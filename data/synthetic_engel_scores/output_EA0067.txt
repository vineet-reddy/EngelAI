Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since starting treatment with brivetiracetam. Specifically, the note states that 'the brivetiracetam seems to have helped her seizures', indicating a reduction in seizures, though exact frequency is not provided. As she continues to experience some disabling seizures, though infrequently, the best Engel score is IIB (Rare disabling seizures since surgery)."
}
```

The note does not provide enough information to confidently assign any other Engel score. If more details on the patient's current seizure frequency and severity were available, additional scores may be justified. However, with the information given, IIB appears to be the most appropriate score.
