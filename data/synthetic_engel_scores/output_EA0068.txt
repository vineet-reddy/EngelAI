Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "1A",
  "reasoning": "The patient is reported to be 'very well and has had no further seizures'. This indicates she has been completely seizure-free since an unspecified prior date, meeting criteria for Engel score 1A - 'Completely seizure-free since surgery'. No date is provided for when seizures stopped, but the lack of any seizures is sufficient for 1A based on the scale's criteria."
}
```

The note states the patient has been seizure-free, so 1A is the appropriate score indicating complete freedom from disabling seizures. No other Engel scores seem valid based on the information given. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
