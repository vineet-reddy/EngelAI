Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IIB.

My reasoning is:

- The patient is experiencing "rare disabling seizures" in the form of generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring about 4 times in the past 3 weeks. This fits the definition of an Engel IIB score ("Rare disabling seizures since surgery").

- While she has almost complete freedom from myoclonic jerks ("about one a week"), these are not considered disabling seizures. Only the generalized tonic-clonic seizures are described as disabling.

- She has prolonged seizure-free intervals of up to 5 weeks, but this does not meet the requirement of greater than 2 years seizure free to qualify for an Engel IIIB score.

- No other Engel score better describes her current seizure status.

In JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring about 4 times in the past 3 weeks. This fits the IIB criteria of rare disabling seizures since surgery. The myoclonic jerks are not considered disabling."
}
```
