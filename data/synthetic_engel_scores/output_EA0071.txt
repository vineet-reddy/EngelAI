Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient had a seizure last week, which was her first seizure since 2006. This indicates that she has rare disabling seizures since her last seizure. There is no mention of surgery in the note. Therefore, based on the Engel criteria, the patient would be classified as IIB - rare disabling seizures since surgery."
}
```

The patient has previously gone several years without seizures, so this recent seizure seems to be a rare event for her rather than frequent seizures. The lack of mention of surgery means criteria related to outcomes after surgery do not directly apply. Therefore, IIB appears to be the most appropriate score based on having rare/infrequent disabling seizures.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
