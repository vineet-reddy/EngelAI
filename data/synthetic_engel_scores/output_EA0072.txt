Based on the information provided, here is the assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has had rare disabling focal motor seizures and secondary generalized seizures since adding lamotrigine. She had one focal motor seizure recently, which indicates rare disabling seizures since the medication change (lamotrigine addition). This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - Rare disabling seizures since surgery (or in this case, since medication adjustment). There is no evidence of complete seizure freedom or prolonged seizure-free intervals to warrant a Class I or III score. The patient has had a worthwhile reduction in seizures, ruling out Class IV."
}
```

The patient has experienced a worthwhile reduction in seizures after adding lamotrigine, but continues to have rare disabling seizures, meeting criteria for Engel IIB. There is only one clear score based on the information provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
