Based on the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been experiencing increasing frequency of 'clumsy' episodes, almost daily, as well as a witnessed convulsive seizure. There has been no appreciable change or reduction in his seizures, indicating an Engel score of IVB (No appreciable change)."
}
```

The note does not mention any prior treatment or surgery, so I have assessed the patient's current seizure status. Given the increasing frequency of episodes and recent convulsive seizure, there has been no worthwhile improvement or reduction in seizures, meeting criteria for Engel IVB.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
