Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IA.

The reasoning is:

- The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 18 and tried on multiple AEDs before being started on sodium valproate 400mg twice daily 9 years ago. 
- She has had no further seizures since being on sodium valproate. This indicates she has been completely seizure-free for over 9 years since starting this medication.
- The criteria for Engel score IA is "Completely seizure-free since surgery." In this case, the "surgery" equivalent would be starting sodium valproate, after which she has been seizure-free.

Therefore, the most appropriate Engel score is IA - Completely seizure-free since the equivalent of "surgery", which in this case was initiation of effective sodium valproate treatment.

The output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been completely seizure-free for over 9 years since starting sodium valproate, meeting criteria for Engel score IA."
}
```

There is only one clear Engel score based on the information provided in the clinical note, so no other possible scores are listed.
