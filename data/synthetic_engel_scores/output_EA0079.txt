Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IIB ("Rare disabling seizures since surgery").

My reasoning is:

- The patient has nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with learning difficulties and symptomatic epilepsy. EEG shows sharpened waveforms consistent with epilepsy.

- He gets around 1 disabling generalized tonic-clonic seizure per month. This frequency of disabling seizures meets criteria for "rare disabling seizures" in the Engel scale.

- There is no mention of the patient having epilepsy surgery, so I cannot assign a score based on post-surgical seizure frequency. However, for this task we were instructed to ignore whether the patient was post-surgery.

- No other Engel score seems applicable based on the information provided. Even though seizure frequency and types are stable and he does not seem to have seizures during the day, having 1 disabling seizure per month still meets Engel IIB criteria.

So in summary, I would assign an Engel score of IIB with the reasoning that he continues to have rare disabling nocturnal generalized seizures. There is no evidence to support alternate scores.

Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has symptomatic epilepsy with nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring around once per month. This frequency of disabling seizures meets criteria for 'rare disabling seizures' in the Engel scale, corresponding to a score of IIB."
}
