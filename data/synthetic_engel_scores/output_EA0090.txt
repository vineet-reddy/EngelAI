Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIA",
  "reasoning": "The patient had been seizure-free for an unspecified period of time before having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure two days before her 9th birthday. This indicates that she was initially free of disabling seizures after some unspecified treatment, but then had a rare seizure recently. This fits the criteria for Engel score IIA - 'Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now'."
}
```

There is no clear evidence to support any other Engel scores based on the details provided. If more information was given about the patient's seizure frequency and response to treatment over time, there could potentially be justification for another score. But with the current information, IIA appears most accurate.
