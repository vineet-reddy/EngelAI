Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient continues to have 'a couple of episodes a week of short-lived vacancy', indicating that she is still having disabling seizures, though they seem to be relatively infrequent ('rare'). This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. Though it is not explicitly stated whether this assessment is post-surgery, the instructions said to ignore that criteria. The seizures do seem to be less frequent with the increased carbamazepine dosage, meeting criteria for 'worthwhile seizure reduction' (IIIA), but she still has rare disabling seizures, fitting IIB better than IIIA."
}
```

The clinical note does not provide enough information to justify assigning any other Engel scores. There is no mention of prolonged seizure-free intervals or nocturnal seizures only that would meet criteria for other scores. Based on the information provided, IIB appears to be the most appropriate score. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
