Based on the information provided, there is not enough evidence to definitively assign an Engel score. The patient had a single witnessed seizure with no prior history of epilepsy. He has not had any seizures since this event over 2 months ago. More information would be needed, particularly related to any recurrence of seizures and his response to treatment, in order to accurately apply the Engel criteria. 

Since an Engel score cannot be reliably assigned, I will return the reasoning without specifying a score:

```json
{
  "score": "Insufficient information",
  "reasoning": "The patient experienced a single witnessed seizure with no prior seizure history. He has not had any seizure recurrence in the over 2 months since this event. More information would be needed regarding any seizure recurrence and response to treatment in order to accurately apply the Engel criteria."
}
```

Please let me know if any additional information becomes available that could allow for assigning an Engel score.
