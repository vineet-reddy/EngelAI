Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since the recent onset of her condition about 6 months ago. She has generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring once or twice a month, with a recent cluster of 3 seizures in one day requiring an ER visit. She also has staring spells occurring 3-5 times per week. These seizures are occurring despite antiepileptic drug treatment with sodium valproate. However, the frequency of disabling seizures appears to meet criteria for Class II - Rare Disabling Seizures. Specifically, subclass IIB fits with rare disabling seizures since the onset of the epilepsy."
}
```

The key factors in determining the Engel IIB score are:
- Recent onset of disabling seizures around 6 months ago 
- Occasional generalized tonic-clonic seizures, up to 1-2 per month
- Recent cluster of 3 disabling seizures in one day
- Frequent non-disabling staring spells occurring multiple times per week
- Seizures occurring despite antiepileptic medication
- Overall pattern fitting category of rare disabling seizures
