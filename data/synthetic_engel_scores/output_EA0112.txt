Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "1A",
  "reasoning": "The note states that the patient 'has been seizure free since starting antiepileptic medication'. This indicates that he has been completely seizure-free since beginning treatment, meeting criteria for Engel score 1A."
}
```

The patient is described as having been seizure-free since starting antiepileptic medication. There is no mention of any seizures, disabling or otherwise, since beginning treatment. This fits the criteria for Engel score 1A - "Completely seizure-free since surgery." In this case, the analogous event to surgery is the patient starting medication. He has been completely seizure-free since that time point.

There are no alternative scores that seem reasonably justified by the information provided. The patient is clearly described as having no seizures. Thus, I have only provided the 1A score along with the clinical reasoning supporting that assessment. Please let me know if any additional detail or alternative perspectives would be helpful!
