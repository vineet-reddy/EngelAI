Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has had rare disabling seizures since the initial seizures in May 2017. She has had a few episodes, with the most recent one occurring last week. These seizures are generalized tonic-clonic seizures that occur from sleep and result in tongue biting, disorientation, etc. This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - rare disabling seizures since surgery (or in this case, since the initial seizures)."
}
```

There is no evidence to support any other Engel scores at this time. The patient has had more than one or two disabling seizures, ruling out Class IIA. She also does not meet criteria for worthwhile seizure reduction or prolonged seizure-free intervals, ruling out Class III. Finally, there is no evidence that seizures are worse or not appreciably changed, ruling out Class IV.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I have assigned this patient an Engel score of IIB. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add.
