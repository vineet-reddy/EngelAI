Based on the information provided, here is the assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "I", 
  "reasoning": "The patient had a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure with possible provoking factors of benzodiazepine withdrawal and sleep deprivation. He has not had any seizures since the initial event 6 months ago. This meets the criteria for Class I - Free of disabling seizures. A more specific subclass cannot be determined given the available information."
}
```

The patient has been seizure-free since the initial event 6 months ago. This meets the general criteria for Class I. However, there is not enough information to further subclassify as IA, IB, IC or ID. Key missing details include:

- Whether he has had any non-disabling simple partial seizures 
- If he has had any seizures related to antiepileptic drug withdrawal
- If there has been any attempt to withdraw antiepileptic medication

Since a more specific Engel score cannot be confidently assigned, the general Class I designation for "Free of disabling seizures" is most appropriate here.
