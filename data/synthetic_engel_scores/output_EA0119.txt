Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is having rare disabling seizures since starting new medication, with a frequency of about 1 seizure per month. This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. Though the patient has not had surgery, the medication changes serve a similar purpose, so this score seems most applicable. None of the other Engel scores accurately capture the seizure frequency and lack of complete seizure control that is described."
}
```

The key factors in choosing Engel IIB are:

- Patient has focal epilepsy with seizures occurring about once per month 
- Seizures are described as "disabling" 
- Seizures have continued at this frequency since recent medication changes
- No other Engel class accurately captures the seizure frequency and lack of complete seizure control

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
