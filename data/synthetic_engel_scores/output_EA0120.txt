Based on the information provided, here is the assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is diagnosed with dissociative seizures and PTSD. He has not had any seizures since his last appointment, but there is no clear timeframe provided for this. The clinical note states that things have 'generally improved' and he is having fewer flashbacks, but no further details are provided regarding his seizures. Without a definitive timeframe or details on seizure frequency, there is no evidence that the patient has had a worthwhile improvement in seizures. Therefore, the best Engel score is IVB - No appreciable change."
}
```

The lack of details on the patient's seizure frequency and timing makes it difficult to accurately assess if there has been any improvement. However, based on the information provided, IVB appears to be the most appropriate score. There is no evidence to support multiple possible scores. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add regarding this patient's seizures.
