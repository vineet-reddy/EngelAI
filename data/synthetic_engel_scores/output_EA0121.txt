Based on the information provided, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score and reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "4B",
  "reasoning": "The patient continues to have frequent focal seizures with altered awareness, occurring in disabling clusters, as well as focal to bilateral convulsive seizures up to 2-3 times per month. This indicates there has been no appreciable reduction in seizure frequency or severity despite trials of multiple anti-epileptic drugs at therapeutic doses over an unspecified period of time. Therefore, the patient would be classified as Engel 4B - no worthwhile improvement, no appreciable change."
}
```

There is no evidence to support alternate Engel scores based on the details given. The patient clearly continues to have frequent disabling seizures without worthwhile improvement, meeting criteria for Engel 4B. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to add regarding the patient's seizure outcomes over time.
