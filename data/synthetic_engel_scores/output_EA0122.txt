Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IC.

The reasoning is:

- The patient has had epilepsy for several years. She experiences generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with the last seizure occurring 2 years ago. Prior to that, she had been seizure-free for 10 years.

- She is currently on sodium valproate (an anti-epileptic medication) which has kept her relatively seizure-free over an extended period.

- Per the Engel criteria, IC is defined as: "Some disabling seizures after surgery, but free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years."

- While it is not clearly stated if the patient has had surgery, the criteria of being free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years fits her current profile.

- There is no evidence provided of other Engel scores being applicable. IC appears to be the best match based on the details given.

Therefore, I would assign an Engel score of IC to this patient.

Here is the response in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IC",
  "reasoning": "The patient has had generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the past but has been free of disabling seizures for the last 2 years. This meets the criteria for Engel score IC." 
}
