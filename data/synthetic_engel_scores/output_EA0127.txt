Based on the information provided, here is the assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been completely seizure-free since February 2005, which was over 2 years ago from the time of this clinic note. This meets the criteria for Engel class IA - 'Completely seizure-free since surgery'. No other Engel scores seem applicable based on the information provided."
}
```

The key points supporting an Engel score of IA are:

- Patient has remained seizure-free since February 2005 
- Last seizure was over 2 years ago from the date of the clinic note
- No mention of ongoing simple partial or disabling seizures
- Meets criteria for IA: Completely seizure-free since surgery

No other Engel scores seem valid based on the details given. There is no evidence of rare/disabling seizures (class II) or worthwhile improvement (class III). The patient is completely seizure-free, rather than just having seizure reduction (class IV).
