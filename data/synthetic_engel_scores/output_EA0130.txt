Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IB.

Here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is described as being free of disabling seizures since her last visit to the clinic in 2005. The only seizures mentioned are 'the ocassional twitch when getting up in the morning whilst she is half asleep'. These do not appear to be disabling seizures. Therefore, an Engel score of IB ('Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery') seems most appropriate."
}
```

There is no clear evidence of multiple possible scores for this patient based on the information given. If additional details emerge that suggest an alternative score may be warranted as well, I would be happy to reassess. Please let me know if any clarification or additional scoring is needed.
