Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IIB (Class II, Subclass B - Rare disabling seizures since surgery).

Here is my reasoning:

- The patient has a diagnosis of secondary generalized seizures due to perinatal trauma. She continues to have around 2 secondary generalized seizures per year. 
- This frequency of disabling seizures falls into the "rare disabling seizures" category according to the Engel criteria.
- There is no mention of the patient having surgery, so Subclass B (Rare disabling seizures since surgery) is most applicable.
- A score of IIB indicates "almost seizure-free" status with rare disabling seizures continuing since the implied surgery or treatment.

I do not see evidence to support multiple possible scores here. The seizure frequency and lack of notable change after adding lamotrigine point to the IIB score.

My response in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient continues to have rare (about 2 per year) disabling seizures since the implied surgery or treatment, meeting criteria for Class II Subclass B."
}
