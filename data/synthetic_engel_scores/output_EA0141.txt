Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has had 3 seizure episodes over the past few months, indicating he is not completely seizure-free. However, the seizures are described as focal onset seizures without generalization. This fits the criteria for Engel class IB - non disabling simple partial seizures only since the presumed start of treatment. While we don't have confirmation he is on anti-seizure medication yet, the recommendation is made to start lamotrigine. So I am assuming the 'since surgery' component can be interpreted more broadly as since the presumed start of treatment to control his seizures." 
}
```

The patient has had recurring focal onset seizures, so does not qualify for class IA "completely seizure-free". Class IB fits best - he has only had non-disabling simple partial seizures, without evidence of secondary generalization. I am assuming the focal onset seizures would be considered "non-disabling" based on the information provided.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
