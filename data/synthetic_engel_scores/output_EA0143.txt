Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "Ms. Jenkins has been completely seizure-free for over 5 years since initially starting treatment with lamotrigine. This meets the criteria for Engel class IA - completely seizure-free since starting treatment. While she recently stopped taking lamotrigine on her own and has remained seizure-free for 2 months, this is still consistent with IA given the timeline. If she were to have another seizure, the score may change to IIA based on having rare disabling seizures after an initial seizure-free period. However, with the information provided, IA appears to be the appropriate score."
}
```

There does not appear to be another Engel score with valid reasoning based on the details in the clinical note. If additional information suggested the possibility of another appropriate score, I would list those variations along with explanatory reasoning. But with what is provided, Engel IA seems most fitting.
