Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since he has around 6 'grand mal' seizures over the past year, which cause injury. He also has non-disabling 'mini shakes' more frequently. This fits the criteria for an Engel score of IIB - rare disabling seizures since surgery."
}
```

The clinical note states the patient has had 6 injurious "grand mal" seizures over the past year, which qualify as rare disabling seizures. He also experiences more frequent non-disabling "mini shakes." Based on these details, the patient meets criteria for an Engel score of IIB - "Rare disabling seizures since surgery."

There is no evidence of multiple possible scores for this patient based on the information provided. The patient has rare disabling seizures that cause injury, unambiguously meeting criteria for score IIB. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
