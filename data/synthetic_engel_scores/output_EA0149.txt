Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there are insufficient details to definitively assign an Engel score. The note indicates that the patient has been experiencing focal seizures with déjà vu, nausea, and an odd taste for the past 10 months, occurring 4-5 times per month. He has not yet undergone MRI imaging or epilepsy surgery. Without clear information on his post-surgical outcome, it is difficult to classify his seizures according to the Engel scale criteria. 

However, to provide a response, I would assign him a score of IIIA - Worthwhile seizure reduction.

Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IIIA",
  "reasoning": "The patient has not undergone epilepsy surgery, so post-surgical Engel criteria do not directly apply. However, he is experiencing focal seizures 4-5 times per month that cause déjà vu, nausea, and an odd taste. These could be classified as 'worthwhile seizure reduction' compared to more severe seizures." 
}
```

I have provided the one score of IIIA as there is insufficient information to determine alternate classifications or if this classification fully fits. More details on his seizure frequency, duration, presence of secondary generalization, etc. would be needed to further classify based on the Engel criteria. Please let me know if any clarification or additional detail is needed!
