Based on the information provided, here is the assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is assigned an Engel score of IIB. He has rare disabling seizures since surgery - specifically he had a cluster of 3 generalized tonic-clonic seizures in a 24 hour period in December. While he has been seizure free otherwise, these seizures would still be considered disabling. He does not qualify for a score of IA since he is not completely seizure free. A score of IB does not apply since he had disabling seizures. While he was seizure free for over 2 years since his last visit, the recent cluster indicates he does not qualify for IC or ID scores. There is no evidence to support scores IIA, IIC, IID, IIIA, IIIB, IVA, IVB, or IVC."
}
```

There is only one clear Engel score based on the information provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
