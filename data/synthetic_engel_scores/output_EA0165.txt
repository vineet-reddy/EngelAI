Unfortunately, the clinical note provided does not contain enough information to definitively assign an Engel score. The note discusses a medication change and resulting side effects, but does not provide any details on the patient's current seizure frequency, severity, or duration of seizure freedom that would be needed to determine an Engel score.

Without further patient details, here is my best attempt at assigning a score:

```json
{
  "score": "III", 
  "reasoning": "There is no clear information provided on the patient's seizure frequency before or after medication changes. The note suggests the patient has previously had good seizure control on his usual Accord Lamotrigine, as changing brands results in side effects and comments from others about appearing intoxicated. This suggests the patient likely has had 'worthwhile seizure reduction' from medications in the past, meeting criteria for Class III. However, without explicit details on seizures, this score is highly speculative."
}
```

If further details on the patient's seizures were available, such as seizure frequency, seizure type, duration of seizure freedom, etc., then a more definitive Engel score could be assigned. But the clinical note lacks these details. Please let me know if any additional patient information can be provided.
