Based on the information provided, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IID",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing nocturnal seizures 'most days'. This frequency of disabling seizures indicates that the patient does not qualify for Engel classes I, II, or III, which require freedom from disabling seizures or only rare disabling seizures. However, since the seizures are occurring at night only, the patient meets criteria IID - 'Nocturnal seizures only'."
}
```

The patient is not completely seizure-free, and continues to experience frequent disabling nocturnal seizures. While a reduction in seizures or prolonged seizure-free intervals is noted, the provided information does not clearly state that this amounts to at least half the follow-up period or a minimum of 2 years as would be required for Engel IIIB. Therefore, based on the information provided, Engel IID appears to be the most appropriate score.
