Unfortunately, the clinical note does not contain enough information to definitively assign an Engel score. The note states the date of the patient's last seizure, but does not provide any details on the frequency, type, or severity of the patient's seizures before or after treatment.

Without further details on the patient's seizure history and response to treatment, here are some possibilities:

```json
{
  "score": "1A",
  "reasoning": "If the patient has been completely seizure-free since an unspecified treatment, this would qualify as 1A. However, there is no clear evidence this is the case."
}

{
  "score": "1B", 
  "reasoning": "If the patient continues to have some non-disabling simple partial seizures since an unspecified treatment, this would be 1B. However, seizure details are not provided."
}

{
  "score": "1C",
  "reasoning": "If the patient was initially seizure-free after treatment but now has some disabling seizures, this would be 1C. But again, seizure details before and after treatment are lacking." 
}
```

As we can see, without further information on the patient's seizure frequency, type, severity, and response to treatment over time, it is difficult to conclusively assign an Engel score. More clinical details would be needed.
