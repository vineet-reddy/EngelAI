Based on the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score and reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "The patient is described as remaining 'seizure free' since previously trying to stop medication and having seizures return. This aligns with an Engel score of IA, which is defined as 'Completely seizure-free since surgery'. Though it is not explicitly stated whether the patient has had surgery, the criteria specify to ignore this aspect. The lack of any reported seizures while on medication also supports the IA classification of being completely seizure-free."
}
```

Since there is no evidence of multiple possible scores, I have provided only the single score of IA with reasoning. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
