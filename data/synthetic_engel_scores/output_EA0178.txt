Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IIB.

My reasoning is as follows:

- The patient is reported to have had 2 seizures in the past 5 months. This indicates she is having rare disabling seizures since starting treatment, meeting criteria for Class II - "Rare disabling seizures ("almost seizure-free")".

- Within Class II, subclass IIB is defined as "Rare disabling seizures since surgery". While it's not clearly stated if the patient has had surgery, the inclusion criteria specified to ignore whether the patient is post-surgery and assign a score anyway. So based on the seizures being described as rare over the time period reported, IIB appears most applicable.

- No other Engel class seems to accurately describe the patient's current seizure frequency and response to treatment. She has had more than rare seizures in total, so does not meet criteria for IIA. And she has not had a prolonged seizure-free period of at least 2 years, so does not meet criteria for IIIB.

In JSON format with reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is reported to have had 2 seizures in the past 5 months, indicating rare disabling seizures since starting treatment. This meets criteria for Class II, subclass IIB - Rare disabling seizures since surgery."
}
```

I do not have evidence to support providing alternative scores based on the information given. Please let me know if any clarification or additional detail for my reasoning would be helpful!
