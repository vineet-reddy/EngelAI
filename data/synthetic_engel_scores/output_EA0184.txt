Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "4B",
  "reasoning": "The patient continues to have disabling seizures including three generalized tonic-clonic seizures and more typical absences since his last appointment. There is no mention of any worthwhile seizure reduction or prolonged seizure-free intervals. He continues to require anti-epileptic medications to try to control his seizures. Therefore, this would be classified as Class IVB on the Engel Scale - no appreciable change in his seizure control."
}
```

The patient does not meet criteria for Class I (seizure free), Class II (rare disabling seizures), or Class III (worthwhile improvement) based on the information provided. He continues to have ongoing disabling seizures with no mentioned improvement, so Class IVB (no appreciable change) is most applicable.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
