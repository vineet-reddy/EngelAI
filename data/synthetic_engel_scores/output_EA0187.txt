Based on the information provided, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient continues to have 3-5 seizures per week despite medication, with no appreciable change in seizure frequency even after an increase in her levetiracetam dose. This indicates no worthwhile improvement in seizures, meeting criteria for Class IVB on the Engel scale."
}
```

The key details supporting an Engel score of IVB are:

- Patient has refractory epilepsy with ongoing seizures despite medications
- She continues to have 3-5 seizures per week 
- There has been no change in seizure frequency even after increasing her levetiracetam dose
- This indicates no appreciable change or worthwhile improvement in seizures

Therefore, based on the lack of worthwhile seizure improvement and no appreciable change, the patient meets criteria for Engel Class IVB. There is no evidence to support alternate Engel scores based on the information provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
