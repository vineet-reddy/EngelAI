Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient had a single seizure with some myoclonic jerks leading up to it. There is no clear evidence that he has an underlying epilepsy syndrome or that he has had any previous unprovoked seizures, other than a single febrile seizure in childhood. His neurological exam was normal. While concerning, a single seizure does not constitute 'no appreciable change' or 'seizures worse' compared to a baseline. Therefore, the best Engel score is IVB - no appreciable change."
}
```

There is not enough evidence to support multiple Engel scores here. The patient had a single event that could represent the onset of an epilepsy syndrome, but there is no prior baseline to compare to. IVB is most accurate based on the information provided.
