Based on the information provided, this patient appears to fit into Engel class IA - Completely seizure-free since surgery.

My reasoning is:

- Patient had right hippocampectomy in 2018
- He has been seizure free since the surgery in 2018
- Prior to surgery, he was having seizures several times a week despite multiple medications
- He is currently on lamotrigine which has been the most effective medication for him
- He has been able to return to work and start driving lessons, suggesting no limiting seizures

There is no evidence of any seizures or even auras since the 2018 surgery. Therefore, I would categorize him as Engel class IA - Completely seizure-free since surgery.
