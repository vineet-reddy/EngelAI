Based on the information provided, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score and reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "IID",
  "reasoning": "The patient has remained seizure-free for 3 years since surgery, indicating a Class I outcome. However, he recently had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure during sleep. Having nocturnal seizures only fits the criteria for an Engel IID classification."
}
```

The key factors in my decision are:

- Patient was seizure-free for over 2 years since surgery, meeting criteria for Class I
- He had a recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure, indicating he is not completely seizure-free (not IA)
- The seizure occurred during sleep, making it a nocturnal seizure
- No other details indicate he has had non-disabling simple partial seizures only (not IB) or rare disabling seizures (not Class II)
- Therefore, having nocturnal seizures only fits the IID criteria

The information provided is quite clear, so I have only provided a single score with reasoning. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to add that could potentially change the scoring.
