Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since his baseline increased from one or two seizures per year to one or two seizures per month. This frequency fits the criteria for Class II Rare Disabling Seizures. Specifically, subclass IIB indicates rare disabling seizures since surgery. In this case, details of any prior surgery are not provided, so I have assumed the patient has not had surgery based on the instructions to ignore surgery status. The seizures are considered disabling given they now occur without any warning signs, increasing risk of injury, compared to his previous seizures which were preceded by a deja vu sensation."
}
```

There is no evidence to support providing alternative scores here, as the information clearly points to the IIB designation based on the details provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
