Based on the clinical note, here is the assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is getting around 2 seizures per month currently, compared to previously having several seizures per week. This indicates a worthwhile reduction in seizure frequency, but the patient still experiences rare disabling seizures since starting treatment. Therefore, an Engel score of IIB ('Rare disabling seizures since surgery') is most appropriate."
}
```

The note does not mention if the patient has had surgery, so I have ignored that aspect and focused on the seizure frequency in assigning the Engel score. Given the information provided, IIB appears to be the only valid score. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
