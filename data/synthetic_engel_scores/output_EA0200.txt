Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has had two generalized tonic-clonic seizures since the unspecified reference point, which would qualify as 'rare disabling seizures since surgery' per the Engel scale criteria. She is currently taking anti-epileptic medication (lamotrigine) to help control her seizures. While the details of her treatment timeline are unclear, she seems to fit the IIB category based on having rare disabling seizures over an unspecified timeframe."
}
```

The details provided in the clinical note are limited, so there is a possibility of other scores depending on the exact timeline. However, IIB appears to be the best fit based on the information given showing she has had rare disabling seizures over an unspecified timeframe. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to provide regarding her case and treatment journey.
