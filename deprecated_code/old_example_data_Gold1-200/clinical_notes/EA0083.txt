Dear Dr Pooled

Re: 	Miss Magi Jones-Williams 			D.O.B: 23/08/1992
8 Mission Place, Llanelwood, SA92 6IE  

Diagnosis:
· Refractory focal epilepsy.  
· Nocturnal generalised tonic clonic seizures with multifocal EEG abnormalities
· MRI negative

Medication:
· Zonisamide 250mgs bd
· Brivaracetam 100mgs bd to increase to 100mgs an, 150mgs pm and after 2 weeks to 150mgs bd

I spoke to Magi today.  Things improved following the birth of her daughter.  She has formed a good bond with her and has now been sterilised.  

More recently she has suffered stress and insomnia and there has been an increase in her seizures.  She is currently having seizures on a weekly basis.  These sound like tonic clonic seizures, with tongue biting and facial injuries.  
She is tolerating her medication well.

Plan:

We discussed the following:

1. It would be useful to review a seizure video if possible 
2. I have advised her to increase the Brivaracetam as shown above 
3. I will have a look through old letters and think about further drug options.  
4. I have suggested that she makes an appointment to see you to consider being prescribed a SSRI to help with her mood.  This would not be contraindicated from an epilepsy point of view 

I will arrange to see her in 6 months’ time  

Yours sincerely
