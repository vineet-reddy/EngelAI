Dear Dr Pooled

Re: 	Mr Richard Harries	D.O.B: 10/10/2005 NHS 566 845 12345

Diagnosis: Frontal lobe epilepsy 

Medication: Carbamazepine 100mg am, 200mg pm (8mg/kg/day)

Follow: up 5 months

I reviewed this young man in the clinic today.   He has been seizure free since before Christmas.  He has no side effects on the Carbamazepine except for he doesnâ€™t like the taste and I have therefore given them a prescription for chewtabs.  If he likes these and can tolerate them, I have asked them to get a repeat prescription from you for this.

We will review him as above.  

Yours sincerely

Yours sincerely
