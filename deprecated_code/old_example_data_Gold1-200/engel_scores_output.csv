"Dear Dr,

Re: 	Mr Iestyn Hitchinbrook DOB 2/3/2000

Diagnosis: 	Drug resistant focal epilepsy			
		Severe learning difficulties

Curent anti-epileptic medication:	Levetiracetam 1500mg bd
				Phenytoin 350mg od
				Zonisamide 200mg bd
				Perampanel 8mg od
				Midazolam as per rescue plan

Previous medications tried:	Sodium valproate, carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine

I reviewed Iestyn by video consultation together with his father who is his main carer. He continues to get frequent seizures which are only really relieved by the midazolam. We have reviewed hi smidazolam plan recently so that he can get up to two 10mg doses of the buccal midazolam should there be a cluster of seizures. His most troubling type of seizure at the moment are focal seizures with altered awareness. These can occur in clusters very frequently so that he doesn’t really recover consciousness. The focal to bilateral convulsive seizures occur less often, perhaps up to 2 or 3 times per month.

As you know he has been extensively investigated for the cause of his epilepsy in the past but I will chase the results of his 100000 genome project in case any results have come from that.

Iestyn’s dad knows that he can contact the epilepsy nurses on their helpline should there be any issues.

Yours 
",IVB,"The patient continues to have frequent focal seizures with altered awareness, occurring in disabling clusters, as well as focal to bilateral convulsive seizures up to 2-3 times per month. This indicates there has been no appreciable reduction in seizure frequency or severity despite trials of multiple anti-epileptic drugs at therapeutic doses over an unspecified period of time. Therefore, the patient would be classified as Engel 4B - no worthwhile improvement, no appreciable change."
"Clinic date 30/01/2018

Diagnosis:  Focal Seizures, probably temporal lobe.			
Medication:      To start Carbamazepine 100mg bd increasing gradually to 400mg bd. 

Thank you for referring this fifty-year-old gentleman to my clinic. 
He reports a history of episodes of altered perception, which he describes as auditory déjà vu. He says that in conversations with people he gets an impression of repetition. His other symptoms consist  of burnt taste in his mouth and , less frequently,  butterflies in his  stomach. The episodes were rare in the past but have become more frequent in the last year, occurring 2-3 times a week for the last 6 months. 
He was diagnosed with ischaemic heart disease some  ten years ago and is on Aspirin and Pravastatin. He works part-time as an accountant and doesn’t drive. He lives with his wife and their grown-up children. 
There is no history of head injury or serious childhood illness, and no family history of epilepsy. He gave up smoking and rarely drinks alcohol. 
His neurological examination today was satisfactory. 
The episodes he is describing are suggestive of temporal lobe seizures and I am requesting an MRI scan with specialist temporal lobe sequences.
I think it would be wise for Mr Hutchinton to be started on medication and Carbamazepine would be the drug of choice here. Could you please commence him of Carbamazepine 100mg bd  increasing by 100mg  increments every two weeks until he reaches a dose of 400mg bd. 
I will review him in six months, but should he not tolerate the medication or there are other issues you may contact my secretary or our epilepsy nurse specialist.

Yours Sincerely,


",IIA,"The patient is experiencing focal seizures consisting of altered perception, déjà vu, and some somatic symptoms. These seizures were previously rare but have increased in frequency over the past year to 2-3 times per week. This pattern fits the IIA criteria of 'Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now.' While not explicitly stated, it is implied that these focal seizures are likely impairing functioning to some degree if requiring medication, meeting the 'disabling' qualification. An argument could potentially be made for a Class I score since seizure frequency and nature is not fully clear over the entire post-operative or follow-up period, but Class IIA is the best fit based on the details provided."

Re. Mr John John Jones D.O.B.: 20/10/1996

Diagnosis: probable focal onset epilepsy
	Anxiety
	Episodic migraine

Current medication levetiracetam 750mg twice a day (to change as detailed below)
Dispersible aspirin and triptans for migraine

I reviewed this 22 year old man together with his partner in clinic today. He has previously been treated by dr Richins for his epilepsy. To recount the history: at the age of 19 whilst at college: he suddenly felt lightheaded and felt strange before blacking out. He woke up in the ambulance and was taken to hospital where sodium valproate was started. He continued to get similar episodes whenever he forgot to take his medication.

With hindsight, Mr Jones’s probably got similar events when he was a teenager. He continues to get episodes every week. During these episodes he feels “Out of his body”, is trapped and is unable to move. Before episodes of complete loss of consciousness he has the same”out of his body” feeling. Unfortunately, he put on a great deal of weight with the sodium valproate and so it was switched to the levetiracetam. He does feel as if his mood is not what it used to be but it is difficult to know if this is down to the medication or not.

Mr Jones had 2 febrile seizures at the age of 12 and 18 months. He was born slightly prematurely at 34 weeks. He has never had any significant head injuries. He has not had meningitis or encephalitis. His mother’s brother has epilepsy and is taking lamotrigne. He currently smokes 20 cigarettes per day and some cannabis on the weekend. He binge drinks 20 pints of lager on most weekends but doesn’t drink alcohol during the week.

I note the Normal MRI in 2017. Two previous EEGs have shown left-sided sharpened waveforms which are suspicious.

Impression: I think on balance these are epileptic seizures given the sterotyped nature of the “out of body” experiences. There have probably been focal to bilateral convulsive seizures as well.

Comments:
As Mr Jones is getting some potential mood effects from the levetiracetam I suggest changing to Brivaracetam at a dose of 75 mg twice a day.
I will ask our epilepsy nurse specialists to contact Mr Jones.
I will review him again in four months time but he can contact our helpline should he have any problems before then.

",IIB,"The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since starting treatment. Specifically, the note states 'He continues to get episodes every week' which indicates more than rare disabling seizures. However, there is no mention of the frequency of seizures prior to starting treatment.

r.e. Carys Edmunds	Date of Birth 03.01.2005	NHS Number: 552 554 553

Diagnosis: 	Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Medication:	Levetiracetam 1500mg bd (50mg/kg/day)
		Lamotrigine 50mg am, 75mg pm increasing by 25mg increments every 2 
weeks to 75mg am, 100mg pm (3mg/kg/day)

Follow Up:	2 months 

I reviewed this young lady in the clinic today.  Carys felt that things were much better as her myoclonic jerks have almost stopped.  She thinks that she has about one a week and they happen when she is stressed. Of rather more concern to her family, is that she is having more generalised tonic clinic seizures.  She has had four in the last three weeks but has had up to five weeks seizure free.  They usually occur in the early hours of the morning.  She wakes up and knows she is going to have one because her arms start jerking.  This carries on for 5 – 10 minutes and then she will have a short-lived generalised tonic clonic seizure.  She is back to normal within half an hour.  

She is otherwise very well and is preparing to do her GCSE exams next year. 

After a long discussion, we have decided to increase her Lamotrigine as above but to leave her Levetiracetam the same.  I did suggest to them that they might like to consider using oral Buccal Midazolam to prevent having a generalised tonic clonic seizure in the night but his may lead to some hangover effect in the morning .

They will go away and think whether they want this.  We will review her as above.

",IIB,The patient is experiencing rare disabling generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring about 4 times in the past 3 weeks. This fits the IIB criteria of rare disabling seizures since surgery. The myoclonic jerks are not considered disabling.

Investigations:	MRI 2016 normal

I reviewed this 20-year-old man today in clinic. He is relatively well although the absences continue fairly frequent, he probably gets 2-3 per day. His last generalised tonic clonic seizure was two years ago. He continues to get some clinical photosensitivity where sunlight through trees can make him feel uncomfortable and sometimes trigger absences. Changing the levetiracetam to zonisamide has helped his mood.

He understands the DVLA laws on driving with epilepsy. I was glad to hear that Herbert is going to study engineering in college shortly and I wish him luck with that. In the mean time I would suggest increasing the zonismaide to 75mg bd. If he has further clusters then the clobazam can also be increased.

Follow Up:	Depending on results of Phenytoin level 

I reviewed Gary with his mother in the clinic today.  His mother told me that his seizure control has been variable but today was a good day.  Mother thought that overall, his control had been good until about a week ago when it had begun to slip.  On Sunday and Monday, he was having generalised tonic clonic seizures in the night and frequent drops and absences throughout the day.  In one of the drops, he had injured his face.  At one point, they found it very difficult to get his drugs down him as he was so “out of it”.  

His control had deteriorated prior to increasing the valproate but had then improved to the odd stare only.

Today he walked in on his own and was his normal chatty, inquisitive self.  His gait was steady, and he wasn’t dribbling.  I saw no overt seizures.  His weight had slightly dropped today to 24.3kg. 

We have arranged for him to have a Phenytoin level done and will get in contact with mother with the result.   We agreed to continue reducing his Topiramte as previously arranged and will then consider reducing his Phenytoin.

Problems:	Recurrent episodes of transient loss of consciousness

Diagnosis:	Probable focal onset epilepsy

Medication:	To start levetiracetam as detailed below

I reviewed this 45-year-old gentleman by telephone consultation today. He continues to get events of loss of consciousness which are difficult to remember for him. Perhaps his last event was in early January.

I did manage to speak with his Wife today. She has seen several events, during these Mr Lewis’ right arm will go stiff before he will collapse to the floor. He shakes and makes unusual guttural noises which can last several minutes. He can sometimes bite his tongue and it takes a few hours for him to recover.

The description of these events today is in keeping with epileptic seizures. I think that Mr Lewis does therefore probably have epilepsy.

I would be grateful if you could start levetiracetam at 250mg once a day increasing by 250mg every two weeks until he is taking 500mg twice a day. I explained that levetiracetam can cause mood disturbance and tiredness, I’ve enclosed an information leaflet about levetiracetam with this letter.

				Focal to bilateral convulsive seizures August 2014 and September 2015

Previous medications tried: Levetiracetam (mood disturbance)
I reviewed Mr Moon by telephone today. I was pleased to hear that he is feeling much better in himself since stopping the levetiracetam and switching to the lamotrigine. His mood is far better and he feels more alert. Unfortunately he still gets his focal seizures with altered awareness where he gets twitching of his right arm. These happen around once per week. He has not had one of his bigger focal to bilateral convulsive seizure for three years now.
We discussed various treatment options. In the first instance I recommend increasing the lamotrigine by 25mg every fortnight until he is on a dose of 175mg bd. The dose can be increased further after this if necessary in a similar way.
As you know he has now had 2 MRI scans. They have both shown a small hyperintensity in the posterior frontal lobe on the left. We discussed these scans at our neuroradiology meeting and the consensus was that this is focal cortical dysplasia. This might mean that there is a surgical option for Mr Moon and so I wil request an up to date EEG and we can discuss further in the next appointment.

		2. AVM

Medication:	1. Levetiracetam 500mg bd
		2. Carbamazepine 300mg bd

Thank you for referring this sixty-six year old retired school master to my epilepsy clinic.  The history is that he suffered a haemorrhage in 2006 from an arteriovenous malformation. This was treated with radiosurgery. Soon after that he started having seizures and had been under the care of my collegue.
  
His epilepsy was well controlled until last December when he had a seizure whilst out walking. Currently his seizures occur 2 to 3 times per month. There is usually a warning in the form of twitching in his left hand and then the episode progresses to a tonic clonic convulsion. 

He says that in his last episode, two weeks ago, he suffered a cut to his forehead, he was alone at the time. He lives with his wife who usually can assist him after a seizure. 

His neurological examination today was normal. 

There is some room to increase his medication to achieve better control of his epilepsy. I suggest that his Carbamazepine is increased to 400mg bd.
I also think that in the light of his seizures returning we should update CT brain scan, and I am requesting the same.  
 

Yours sincerely

",IIB,"The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since his surgery in 2006 to treat an AVM. Specifically, it is stated that he started having seizures soon after the 2006 surgery, indicating he has had seizures since then. Recently, the note says he is having seizures 2-3 times per month. This frequency would still be considered 'rare' based on the Engel criteria definitions.

Dear Dr,

Re: 	Mrs Sylvia Lorenzo. DOB 18/02/1954

I reviewed this 52-year-old woman in clinic today, together with her husband. She was referred for ongoing management of her epilepsy and so I will recap her epilepsy history.

Mrs Lorenzo was born normally. She had one febrile seizure at the age of 3 years. She had a mild viral meningitis at the age of 18 years but has not had any encephalitis or significant head injuries.  She had three A-levels and studied law at university before going on to work as a paralegal. At the age of 32 she had a significant collapse and was found to have a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured ACA aneurysm. This was treated with endovascular coiling. She possibly had one seizure at the time of the subarachnoid haemorrhage but was not started on medication as it was thought that this was an acute symptomatic seizures.

Three years later, at the age of 35 she had two episodes of transient loss of consciousness which were thought to be tonic-clonic seizures and she was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 36. Initially she was treated with phenytoin but this was switched to levetiracetam 2 years ago. Currently she is taking 750mg twice a day of the levetiracetam and her last seizure was 2 years ago. She has returned to work and is driving. She lives with her husband and two sons. He youngest son had 2 febrile seizures and had childhood absence epilepsy although he is now seizure free. She doesn’t smoke but drinks around 12 units of alcohol (6 cans of lager) a week.

Apart from the epilepsy she takes ramipril for hypertension and simvastatin for hypercolestrolaemia.

Mrs Lorenzo does find that she is very irritable and short tempered since starting the levetiracetam. This seems to be having an effect on her quality of life and she would be very keen to change this.

Her neurological examination today was essentially normal. Blood pressure was 126/67, her pulse was 68 and regular.

A recent CT scan on 3/7/2016 is degraded but the artefact from the coil but does show an area of gliosis in the right frontal lobe. An EEG from 1990 shows slow waves with ocassional right sided sharp waves.

I agree with the diagnosis of symptomatic structural epilepsy, secondary to the previous sub-arachnoid haemorrhage. Given the significant modd changes which are likely due to side effects of the levetiracetam I would suggest changing to brivetiracetam. This can be done with a straight switch to 75mg bd of the brivetiracetam. I went through the DVLA guideance on driving when switching medication.

I will review her in clinic in 6 months time and will ask for an epilepsy nurse review.

Seizure type and frequency: generalised tonic clonic seizures, last seizure two years ago 

I spoke with Mrs Liver on the telephone today. She is now 47 years old. She has had epilepsy for several years. She does not get seizures very often and her last seizure was two years ago. She previously has been 10 years without seizures. There are no obvious triggers to her seizures but they are frequently associated with stressful situation.

However she has no plans for more children and her periods are becoming irregular.

He is currently taking Carbamazepine and Eplim Chrono 1000mg bd, he does not know the does of carbazmazepine that he takes.

His generalised seizures start with some change in behaviour followed by a loss in consciousness. He will shake for a few minutes and then be very confused afterwards. They have not happen now for at least 5 years.

Richard has also had additional events of the last few years. During these he will feel a bit vague and not himself but will return to normal a few minutes laters. They happen a few times a years. His blood pressure has been measured to be a bit low a few times e.g. 80-90 systolic. I will request some ambulatory blood pressure monitoruing and also ask Richard’s wife to take some videos of these other attacks which I don’t think some typically like seizures.

I reviewed this 50-year-old man in clinic today. As you know his epilepsy started around 10 years ago, 2 months after having brain surgery to drain an abcess in his right frontal lobe. He has partial motor seizures involving left arm twitching with retained awareness. He gets these every month. He has also had secondary generalised seizures, they happen about every year, his last one was on Christmas day 2009.

For the last two years he has had different kinds of attacks. They are brought on by stress.
He has his eyes closed during them and they can last up to 15mins. He will have tremor-like movements of his arms which will wax and wane. Last year he had an EEG which captured one of these events and with no EEG changes confirmed a diagnosis of non-epileptic psychogenic seizures.

He has hypertension for which he takes amlodipine. He also has anxiety and depression. He does not take medication for this and his mood is stable at the moment.

He is quite tired and finds it difficult to concentrate and so I would suggest reducing the oxcarbazine slowly by 100mg every week until it stops. I will refer him to our non-epileptic attack disorder service for management of the non-epileptic attacks

Problems	Episodes of transient loss of consciousness

Diagnosis:	Probable focal onset epilepsy

I reviewed this 51-year-old man together with his wife in clinic today.

He has had several episodes of transient loss of consciousness. The latest occurred on the the 13th of Apirl 2015. His wife was awoken by a very unusual and scary noise-Mr Jones was making very loud groaning noises. He was stiff and shaking and lips were blue. The shaking lasted around 2 minutes and it took around 2 hours for Mr Jones to fully recover. His leg and arm muscles were aching the next day.

He had a very similar episode from sleep last year. With hindsight he has also had several episodes of altered awareness where he’s had a difficult to describe feeling, similar to deja-vu. These are probably focal seizures with altered awareness.

He is currently not working and has hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia for which he takes simvastatin and ramipril. He also takes clopidogrel as he had a myocardial infarction in 2010. A CT head on 13/4/2015 was normal and his ECG was also normal.

Mr Jones was born 3 week early and there was a prolonged labour although he did not need to spend time in SCBU. He had 4 febrile seizures between the age of 9 months and 3 years. His father might have had epilepsy, otherwise there is no history of note.

I do think that the episodes of transient loss of consciousness were focal to bilateral convulsive epileptic seizures. He therefore has epilepsy and also has had focal seizures with altered awareness (the deja-vu episodes).

I explained the diagnosis to Mr Jones and his wife and the fact that epilepsy is a tendency to have ongoing seizures which can be thought of as electrical disturbances in the brain. Although epilepsy is common and most seizures are uneventful, seizures can occasionally be dangerous and very rarely can cause injury and very rarely can even cause death (sudden death in epilepsy). It’s therefore very important to treat the seizures and I advise that Mr Jones has an anti-epileptic medication long term. I suggest that he starts taking lamotrigine, initially a dose of 25mg once a day. I explained that generally lamotrigine is very well tolerated but occasionally can cause a rash when starting and should this happen he should stop the treatment and seek medical advice. I have enclosed an information leaflet on lamotrigine with this letter. I’d be very grateful if you could increase lamotrigine by 25mg every fortnight until he is taking 75mg twice a day.  I explained the DVLA driving laws about epilepsy and the fact that the DVLA advice that Mr Jones informs them of the diagnosis and he should refrain from driving until he has been a year free of all seizures. · I will ask our epilepsy specialist nurses to go through the diagnosis with Mr Jones. I will also request an MRI brain for further information. Should there be any issues with his epilepsy or epilepsy medication before then, yourself or Mr Jones can contact us via our epilepsy helpline, the telephone numbers and email addresses are above

",IVB,"The patient has a diagnosis of probable focal onset epilepsy with episodes of transient loss of consciousness that appear to be focal to bilateral convulsive seizures as well as focal seizures with altered awareness. He continues to have seizures, with the most recent seizure occurring around 5 months ago. There is no mention of any reduction in seizure frequency or duration. Therefore, this would be classified as Class IVB - no appreciable change in seizures."

He is now getting approximately 1 generalised tonic clonic seizure every two months. We discussed the risks of sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP) but Mr Evans does not want to make any changes to his medication.

I would suggest increasing the levetiracetam to 1500mg bd in steps of 250mg every fortnight. There have been problems with complicance in the past and Owen has forgotten to take his medication. I have re-emphasied the importance of taking medication regularly. A further follow up has been arranged.

Diagnosis: Nocturnal seizures ? Benign Rolandic Epilepsy of Childhood

Medication:	Nil

Follow Up:	For sleep deprived EEG 
		Review in 2 months

Thank you very much for referring this 6 year old girl whom we saw with her mother in the clinic today.  She has had four generalised tonic clonic seizures, always occurring in sleep.  Two of them occurred within 24 hours of each other and they all occurred within a 10 day period where she had a bit of a cold and was probably sleep deprived.  

Hannah can remember nothing about these episodes but father gives a good description of them.  In the first one, having been woken by a noise he went into her bedroom to find her stiff and jerking all over with excess salivation.  The episode lasted less than a minute and when she came around, she was drowsy.  

In the third episode, which he witnessed from the beginning, he wondered whether her right lip twitched first but then she rapidly went on to have a generalised tonic clonic seizure.  

She has had no other episodes.  

She has otherwise been fit and well.  She is doing well at school.  

Her mother had a small number of seizures when she was approximately the same age as and took what was probably Sodium Valproate for 3-4 years.

On examining her today, there were no abnormalities to find.

Her baseline EEG was within normal limits.

I wondered whether this is Benign Rolandic Epilepsy of Childhood and therefore we will arrange for her to have a sleep deprived EEG to see if we can bring out any centrotemporal spikes.  It will also allow us to see if anything happens in the EEG when she goes to sleep as this is when she has had her seizures.  This should help us in the decision making process about whether we should start her on any anticonvulsants or whether they can simply try and avoid the provokers. 

The parents know the first aid treatment of seizures and I have reassured them that they are unlikely to miss any episodes. 

We will review her in three months time.  If she has any further episodes, the family should ring outpatients to see if they can get an earlier appointment.


",IID,"The patient has had 4 generalized tonic-clonic seizures, occurring only during sleep. She has had no seizures while awake. This fits the criteria for Engel Class IID - 'Nocturnal seizures only'. While she has had more than one seizure, they have all occurred during sleep, so Class IID appears most applicable. There is no mention of any seizure reduction or prolonged seizure-free intervals, so Classes III and IV do not seem accurate. Since all seizures have occurred during sleep, Class IID 'Nocturnal seizures only' is the best fit based on the details provided."

Re. Miss Amber Clarke D.O.B.: 29/06/2000

Problem	Episodes of transient loss of consciousness

Diagnosis: Epilepsy
	Diabetes

I reviewed this 19 year old woman together with her mother in clinic today. She has no had 4 events in total. They have happened roughly every year since the age of 15. They have mostly happened during sleep. They all seem to be pretty much the same. On all occasions she has bitten the side of her tongue. After the events she normally feels quite confused and needs to go to sleep.

Her mother has seen some of these episodes. She recalled one of them where Miss Clarke was shaking her arms and legs whilst unconscious and making unusual groaning noises. 

As you know Miss Clark is a diabetic and uses insulin. Her blood sugars have been checked after at least two of these episodes and have been within the normal range. They do feel different to her normal hypoglycaemic attacks. There is no obvious history of absence or myoclonic seizures.

She would like to start driving in the future. She currently works as a hairdresser. A paternal grandmother had seizures associated with brain tumour but otherwise there is no other significant medical history in the family. She had one febrile seizure at the age of eight months. There is no history of significant cerebral brain infections or head injuries.

The neurological examination today in clinic was normal. I note an ECG in the notes from may 2019 which showed a normal PR interval, corrected QT interval and normal QRS axis.

I do think that these episodes are probably epileptic seizures, particularly as Blood sugars recorded have been normal. I think that Miss Clark has the syndrome of epilepsy with tonic 
clonic seizures alone.

Comments:

I explained the diagnosis to miss Clark and her mother. I explained the importance of treating any epileptic seizures, particularly given the risk of injury and even rarely death (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy).
I think she should start the dose of lamotrigine of 25 mg once-a-day. I would increase this by 25 mg every two weeks. I have enclosed an information leaflet on lamotrigine with this letter.
I explained the current DVLA driving rules.
I will request an EEG and an MRI.

",IIA,"The patient has a history of 4 seizure episodes over the past 4 years, which equates to around 1 seizure per year. This frequency would be considered ""rare"" based on the Engel criteria. The seizures are described as episodes of unconsciousness with tongue biting and post-ictal confusion, indicating they are likely disabling seizures. The patient was initially seizure-free from age 8 months (after a febrile seizure) until the first event at age 15. She then began having rare disabling seizures, meeting criteria for Engel IIA."

Dear Dr,

Re: 	Mrs Jeana Johns D.O.B. 19/04/1966

Diagnosis:	Secondary generalised seizures secondary to perinatal trauma

I reviewed Mrs Johns in clinic today. As you know she was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 4. The reason for her epilepsy is that she had some hypoxia during a difficult birth.

She continues to have around 2 secondary generalised seizures per year. Her seizure was about 2 months ago. They always start with some right sided arm movement and then Mrs Johns has around 10 seconds before she looses consciousness. She has taken sodium valproate for a long time and is currently taking 1g twice a day. The last time I saw her I advised starting lamotrigine. She is now taking 50mg twice a day. She thinks that this may have helped her seizures and interestingly her mood has improved since taking the lamotrigine. She also takes sertraline for her anxiety and depression.

Her MRI does show some gliosis and changes in the left fronto-temporal region consistent with a perinatal injury and an EEG in 2010 showed left sided fronto-temporal spikes.

I would suggest increasing the lamotrigine by 25mg every month until she is on 75mg bd and I will continue to review in clinic.

Yours

Re: 	Mrs Lorna Liver DOB 29/05/1972

Diagnosis: longstanding epilepsy with generalised tonic clonic seizures 

Medication: epilim 200 milligrammes in the morning and 400 milligrammes nokte 

Many thanks for asking me to see this 43 year old lady who was diagnosed with epilepsy around 16 years ago by doctor Hampton. History is consistent with generalised tonic clonic seizures. She has never had any aura. When she gets seizures she can get incontinence and some confusion afterwards for around 30 minutes. There is no history of any myoclonic jerks or absences. 

Her birth was normal and so were her developmental milestones. No history of febrile seizures, head injury, brain infections or family history of epilepsy. She has not got any significant medical problems.

Investigations in the past have included a normal ECG and CT scan. She told me that her eeg has shown evidence of epilepsy in the past. 

She has been treated with epilim from the onset. Her seizure frequency has reduced from about once a year  to. 1 seizure every two to three years whilst taking the Eplim. Her longest period without seizures has been 4 years.

She is married and has no children. She works as a barmaid in a local restaurant . She normally drinks about four cans of cider in a week. 

Her examination today was normal, heart rate was 48 beats per minute and regular , her neurologic examination is essentially normal.

She has longstanding infrequent generalised tonic-clonic seizures. I will investigate further with an EEG and MRI scan of the brain. I had a long discussion with her regarding the side effects of epilim especially the effects of the unborn baby. We did discuss alternative medicine but she would like to stay on Eplim. I would suggest that she increases the dose to 400 milligrammes in the morning, 200 milligrammes in the lunchtime and 400 milligrammes in the evening

Dear Doctor,
Diagnosis: juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
Medication: 	citalopram
		To start levetiracetam as detailed below
It was a pleasure to review this 20 year old chemistry student, together with her father in clinic today. She started noticing that her arms were “jerky” in the morning when she was 13 years old. Sometimes she has dropped things because of these jerks. Sometimes she has notices that sunlight through trees can provoke these jerks. She has never had any episodes of loss of conscious.
She was born normally, did not have any febrile seizures, meningitis or significant head injury. Interestingly her mother has epilepsy that is well controlled with sodium valproate. Her mother used to get myoclonic seizures as well. She has suffered from depression in the past but her mood has been stable for years after starting the citalopram
She is at university at Swansea and enjoying her studies. She doesn’t smoke but does binge drink on the weekend. She lives in a shared house with 6 other students.
An EEG last year showed generalised spike, polyspike and wave with photosensitivity. An MRI on 1/2/2018 was normal apart from an incidental arachnoid cyst.
Impression: I think that the jerks are myoclonic seizures, and this, together with the abnormal EEG gives the diagnosis of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.
Comments. I explained the diagnosis to Miss Howells and her father. I explained the importance of treatment with an anti-epileptic drug given the risk of convulsive seizures. There is the rare but real risk of serious injury or even death with convulsive seizures (Sudden Death in Epilepsy).
I would therefore suggest starting levetiracetam 250mg od increasing by 250mg every fortnight until she is taking 500mg bd.
I wil review her again in 3 months but she can contact us before then should there be a problem.

Diagnosis:
· Focal epilepsy

Medication:
· Brivaracetam 50mgs bd

I spoke to David on the phone today.  I am pleased to say that he has been seizure free since starting antiepileptic medication.  

Unfortunately however, he has had problems with mood swings and irritability.  He switched Levetiracetam to Brivaracetam, with a little improvement. He has a good insight into potential causes of this, including the impact the diagnosis has had on his mental health and lifestyle, particularly inability to drive, and the general impact of COVID and lockdown.  

Plan:

We discussed the options of continuing Brivaracetam, or switching to an alternative medication, such as Lamotrigine.  While it is possible that this would be better in terms of irritability, there is no guarantee that it would control his seizures as well and for now he would prefer to continue unchanged.  He knows how to get hold of us on the above helpline number as needed.

I reviewed Rhodri today in the Virtual First Seizure Clinic.  He is a 21-year-old gentleman who had his first seizure at the age of 12 and was investigated by paediatrics.  He has had on average one seizure a year since the age of 17 but a total of 3 in 2020. 

In general, they have occurred without warning. There is generalised stiffening and shaking, stertorous breathing and cyanosis. He has bitten his tongue and is postictal for up to 48 hours afterwards.  One occurred on waking and one after a night out.  

There is a history of what sound like myoclonic jerks, sometimes in the morning affecting his limbs often after nights out.  

He is not on any medication, there is no family history of note and there is no history of intracranial infections, head injuries or febrile convulsions.  

He lives with his family and works for Admiral. He is driving.  He is a non-smoker and k alcohol on weekends.

The story here is suggestive of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy and I would suggest the following:

1.	He needs some up to date investigations with an MRI brain and EEG which I will arrange
2.	I think he needs to be on medication and I have suggested Sodium Valproate as shown above.  The main side effects to be aware of are tiredness, light-headedness and occasional weight gain and a tremor.  
3.	We discussed driving and I have advised him to contact the DVLA and that he should refrain from driving until he has been seizure free for 12 months.

·         Epilepsy is relatively common, affecting around 30,000 people in Wales. Epilepsy causes seizures which can be thought of as electrical disturbances in the brain. Although most seizures are uneventful sometimes seizures can cause injury and very rarely seizures can cause serious injury or even death (Sudden Death in Epilepsy – SUDEP).
·         Given this it is important to treat the seizures with medication to reduce the risk of seizures happening. Overall there is around a 70% of treating the seizures successfully with medication.
·         I would be grateful if you could continue to prescribe the levetiracetam. I have enclosed an information leaflet on levetiracetam with this letter. If Mr Richards has further seizures then I would increase it to 1000mg bd. It could be further increased after that to 1250mg bd
·         Levetiracetam is generally well tolerated but occasionally can cause mood changes
·         In terms of driving, I explained the current DVLA rules on driving with epilepsy. Mr Richards needs to stop driving and inform the DVLA of the diagnosis. He is not able to drive until he has been 1 year free of seizures.
·         It would be important to consider safety in some activities where seizures could be dangerous. For example Mr Richards should not have baths alone and take showers instead and climbing ladders or operating some types of machinery could be dangerous. I also explained some first aid measure of what to do when a seizure happens.
·         Having said this it is important to lead as normal life as possible and most people with epilepsy can do this.

• Single generalised tonic clonic seizures with possible provoking factors

I spoke to this 24-year-old gentleman today in the  First Seizure Clinic.  The event in question occurred in May. He was outside walking, when he had a sudden loss of consciousness without warning.  He came around feeling sick and was very confused for over an hour.  Witnessed described, how his arms stiffened, raised above his head and had generalised limb jerking.  He did not bite his tongue.  He has not had any further episodes since.  

There is a history of recreational drug use, including benzodiazepines, which he had stopped taking for 2 days before the event in question.  There is no previous history of seizures, head injuries, intracranial infections and he has not had any further episodes since.  He is otherwise well and not on any regular medication.  
He lives with his parents, is not working and has not been driving.  He denies excess alcohol.

Impression:
This gentleman has had an event suggestive of a single generalised tonic clonic seizure, possibly triggered by Benzodiazepine withdrawal and sleep deprivation.  For completeness I will arrange an MRI scan of the brain and 12 lead ECG, but I explained that we would not start him on any antiepileptic medication.
We discussed the driving regulations and he will need to inform the DVLA and refrain from driving for 6 months.

Thank you for referring this 41 year old lady for review at the epilepsy clinic. She was discharged from the clinic in 2005. I am happy to say that there has not been any recurrence of seizures since we last saw her at the clinic. She might have had the ocassional twitch when getting up in the morning whilst she is half asleep. She does not have any side effects from either the lamotrigine or sodium valproate and does not want to make any changes.

I went over the teratogenicity of sodium valproate. Ms Rutter has already read the sodium valproate information booklet. We completed the annual sodium valproate risk form in clinic today. I will request a review from the epilepsy nurses in a year’s time.

Mild Learning difficulties

Medication: sodium valproate 500 milligrams mane 700 milligrams nocte 
Zonisamide 50mg bd

Outcome: alterations as directed to achieve maintenance of zonisamide 100mg bd, sodium valproate dose unchanged.

I reviewed Ms house who is now 47 years old. She came with her mother and it was a new referral in the first seizure clinic. She has a historic diagnosis of epilepsy and was diagnosed at the age of 6 years old.

She had severe childhood measles. She developed learning difficulties which was probably a result of the measles.

She has previously been under the care of my colleague. The cause of her epilepsy was deemed to be secondary to the measles. She gets 2 seizure types which are: generalised tonic clonic seizures, the last occurred three years ago. Secondly she gets absence events where she pauses her task and her head turns to one side and she will stare vacantly. These will last for a few seconds. These currently happen around once a week and are provoked by sleep deprivation. 

A recent increase in the sodium valproate dose has resulted in increased drowsiness, she's also noticed the problem with tremor in her hands. In the past she's had an MRI brain scan which does show some premature atrophy and some white matter hyperintensities. 

On examination today there was some mild gum hyperplasia and she had increased tone in her lower limbs with normal power and brisk reflexes. 

As she still getting further seizures I suggest increasing the zonisamide by 50 milligrams every week until it is on a dose of 100 milligrams twice a day. I have given her some information on seizures and epilepsy and how to contact the epilepsy nurses in future should there be any problems

I reviewed this patient again in my clinic today. She was not feeling very well and was quite depressed. Her seizures are reasonably controlled by her low mood as well as some agitation is causing her some distress.
 
I think that the levetiracetam she is taking could well be contributing to this and so I would recommend reducing and stopping this over the next 2 months and increasing the carbamazepine instead.
 
Please can you therefore;
 
Increase the carbamazepine to 600mg twice a day.
Reduce the levetiracetam by 250mg every week until it is stopped completely.
 
I will see her in two months to see how she is getting on.

I reviewed this 19 year old woman by telephone today. I was pleased to hear that she has not had any further seizures since her last clinic appointment and since starting the lamotrigine. We had a chat of the ongoing need to take medication. This is because of the risks that convulsive seizures have. I explained that the EEG changes, which show a generalised pattern, are in keeping with the syndrome of a generalised epilepsy with tonic clonic seizures alone. I explained that the EEG also showed evidence of photosensitivity. This means that Miss Clark should be careful around flashing lights and patterns of sunlight through trees which may provoke seizures.

I reviewed this young lady in the clinic today.  She felt that things were much better as her myoclonic jerks have almost stopped.  She thinks that she has about one a week and they invariably occur when she is stressed. Of rather more concern to her family, is that she is having more generalised tonic clonic seizures.  She has had four in the last three weeks but has had up to five weeks seizure free.  They usually occur in the early hours of the morning.  She wakes up and knows she is going to have one because her arms start jerking.  This carries on for 5 – 10 minutes and then she will have a short-lived generalised tonic clonic seizure.  She is back to normal within half an hour.  

After a long discussion, we have decided to increase her Lamotrigine as above but to leave her Levetiracetam the same.  I did suggest to them that they might like to consider using oral Buccal Midazolam to prevent having a generalised tonic clonic seizure in the night but his may lead to some hangover effect in the morning and therefore may make the seizures more intrusive.

I have left them to go away and think about this.  We will review her as above.

Dear Doctor,
Date seen 4-JUN-2016
Diagnosis: temporal lobe epilepsy
Medication: omeprazole
		Thyroxine
		Eslicarbazine 800mg od
		Zonisamide 100mg bd

Thank you for referring this 44 year old man for a specialist epilepsy opinion. His seizures started at the age of 32. His partner was able to give a good description of his seizures. He feels funny and needs to sit down, he may appear to smile without emotion and his hands may twitch a bit. He is unable to respond properly during the seizures. Sometime he will repeat questions like “who are you?”. These sound like complex partial seizures.
Normally he will have around 2-3 seizures per month but has gone 6 months seizures free.
His memory is getting worse and his partner says that despite writing things down in lists he still forgets to do things and ocassionally forgets his tables.
He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He was born after a normal vaginal delivery at term. He developed normally and was “average” at school. There is no history of febrile seizures or meningitis or head injury.
He left school at 16 and works as a bartender but unfortunately lost his job after the epilepsy started. He is right handed, has never smoked and drinks around 10 pints of pale ale per week.
Neurological examination today was normal.
He had a MRI in 2006 which was normal and an EEG at the time showed some possible abnormalities in the right temporal lobe.
We discussed the possibility of epilepsy surgery and Mr Richards felt that it would be worth pursuing. I will therefore request an up to date MRI and request video EEG telemetry. In the mean time it would be worth increasing the eslicarbazine to 1200mg od.

I spoke to this 67 year old gentleman by telephone consultation today and also spoke with his wife. His episodes started on 13th June 2018. He was moving his car and seemed to go into a ‘day dream’. He  has very little memory of the event. He did not have any warning that this was happening. He has had several episodes where he seemed to go into a day dream. His wife said that he looks vacant when they were happening. He was still and didnt move but didnt look himself at all.
 
He’s had three episodes whilst asleep where he's shook his arms and made unusual choking noises. These have lasted about a minute. He's felt ok afterwards afterwards. His wife was worried about his airway. His last episode was on 31st August 2018.
 
He has no significant medical problems. He's never had any episodes like this in the past and doesnt take any regular medication. There were no problems when he was born and he hasnt had any febrile seizures, significant cerebral infections or significant head injuries. He has retired now for 5 years, previously he worked as a manufacturing engineer. He doesnt smoke and drinks around 16 units of alcohol per week. He lives with his wife and drives. He doesnt have any family history of epilepsy
 
An MRI brain from September 2018 has been normal.
 
Impression
 
I think that this is focal onset epilepsy. The smaller episodes are focal seizures with altered awareness and the episodes during sleep are focal to bilateral convulsive seizures
 
Comments:       
 
I explained the diagnosis of epilepsy
Epilepsy is relatively common, affecting around 30,000 people in Wales. Epilepsy causes seizures which can be thought of as electrical disturbances in the brain. Although most seizures are uneventful sometimes seizures can cause injury and very rarely seizures can cause serious injury or even death (Sudden Death in Epilepsy – SUDEP).
I would be grateful if you could prescribe lamotrigine. I have enclosed an information leaflet on lamotrigine with this letter. Please prescribe lamotrigine starting at 25mg once a day and increase by 25mg every fortnight to a dose of 75mg twice a day.
Lamotrigine is generally well tolerated but occasionally can cause a rash. If this should happen he should seek medical attention.
In terms of driving, I explained the current DVLA rules on driving with epilepsy. He needs to stop driving and inform the DVLA of the diagnosis. He is not able to drive until he has been 1 year free of seizures.
I will also arrange an EEG.
I will also ask our epilepsy nurses to go through the new diagnosis with him.
",IIB,"The patient has had rare disabling seizures since the onset of his epilepsy in June 2018. He has had 3 focal to bilateral convulsive seizures during sleep, which are disabling. He has also had several focal seizures with altered awareness while awake, which may be considered disabling as well since he was driving during one episode. He continues to have rare disabling seizures, most consistent with an Engel score of IIB."

I review Owen without the benefit of his old case notes. His epilepsy started at the age of 3 years. He has nocturnal generalised tonic clonic seizures which are associated with mild learnind difficulties. He has symptomatic epilepsy. EEGs in the past have shown sharpened waveforms in the frontal leads. I do not have the results of his previous brain imaging.

His epilepsy has been stable over the last few years and he gets around 1 generlised tonic clonic seizure in his sleep per month. He has previously tried topiramate and phenytoin and he is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg twice a day and carbamazepine 400mg twice a day.

I suggest that he increases the carbamazepine by 200mg every two weeks until he is taking 600mg twice a day. If there is no improvement in his seizure frequency then we would consider a different anti-convulsant medication. He is not keen on epilepsy surgery at the moment.

As he has been on carbamazepine for a while I will check his bone profile.

Many thanks for referring this 49 year old lady for increasing seizures. The onset of the seizures was at the age of 16 and she was diagnosed with epilepsy at the sunshine hospital. She had a good response to Eplim. In the past she's also tried lamotrigine which has made things worse. When she was pregnant for the first time 15 years ago she stopped taking her medication.

She has no other significant medical problems. She did have a febrile seizure the age of four years and a maternal aunt also has epilepsy, she also has migraine.

However, the history provided indicates she has rare disabling seizures since stopping and restarting medication in the context of pregnancy.

This man has remained seizure free for three years and he had return to drive. However he had another seizure whilst he was asleep on the 2nd November. His wife heard a loud and unusual noise which woke her up. He then went stiff and was shaking for around 5 mins. 

He has recently has some contact with the mental health services due to issues of continued low mood. There are no side effects from the Tegretol.

In the first instance I would suggest increasing the morning dose to 600mg so that he takes 600mg twice a day. He understands the DVLA driving regulations which state that he needs to be a year free of seizures before driving again.

Re: Ms Haana Habley D.O.B 30/01/1972

I reviewed this 41 year old lady with symptomatic epilepsy due to previous neurocysticercosis. She gets frequent focal dyscognitive seizures in clusters. Last week she had around 10-15 of these seizures over 2 days. There was no obvious provoking factor.

As you know she had an abnormal CT scan in 2000 which showed calcifications consistent with her neurocysticercosis. A recent MRI in 2011 was normal. She has previously tried levetiracetam but it caused mood disturbance and is now taking lamotrigine 150mg bd. We discussed various treatment options. Mrs Habley does not want any further children and this will leave more options in terms of drug treatment.

We decided to try and increase in the lamotrigine in the first instance. Please increase by 25mg every fortnight until she is taking 200mg bd. If this increase is not successful then I would suggest introducing zonisamide 25mg od increasing by 25mg every fortnight to a target dose of 75mg bd. Zonisamide can cause weight loss and can slightly increase the risk of kidney stones.

She continues to get a number of episodes which she says are “dizzy spells”.  These last for a few minutes.  Her hearing is altered during them.  Doing a video EEG she had some of these episodes and there was no epileptiform EEG correlate.
 
I had reviewed some videos of some of her events which did seem to be nonepileptic in nature.

During these seizures she will have a strange feeling of a rising epigastric sensation and then have some strange ""flashback"" type thoughts.
 
As you know she was born normally but started having seizures at the age of around 5 years. She has not had febrile seizures but was knocked unconscious briefly at the age of 10 after falling off her bike. A paternal grandfather has epilepsy. As you know Carol has previously seen the CAMHS service for her anxiety. Carol seemed to be quite anxious today but she does have an appointment with the community mental health team tomorrow.

Re          Ms Leila              Jenkins DOB 20/10/1984
 
Thank you for referring Ms Jenkins to the epilepsy clinic. She is 33 years old and works in the retail industry. She lives alond and drives. She drinks alcohol at the weekend (about 30 units). She does not smoke.
 
Her seizures started at the age of 19 and she was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 22. Initially she was treated with lamotrigine. Her seizures were consistent with a temporal lobe semiology. She gets nausea and some oro-facial automatisms as well as dejavu. These events, which are focal seizures with altered awareness, used to happen weekly but her last event was more than five years ago. She has only every had one secondarily generalised seizures which happend when she was 22, the morning after a night out.At the time an MRI showed a small hyperintensity in the right amygdyla. There has been one follow up scan which showed no change in the size of the lesion.
 
As Ms Jenkins has been a long time without having a seizure she decided to stop her medication herself 2 months ago. She has not had any seizure as a result of this.
 
we discussed the implications of stopping the medication. It is difficult to know the reoccurance risk of seizures with certainty but an estiamte would be around 50% in the next 2 years. This would have an implication for herdriving status.
 
We advised that Ms Jenkins continues with the lamotrigine. We will repeat the MRI scan and review with the results.

",IA,"Ms. Jenkins has been completely seizure-free for over 5 years since initially starting treatment with lamotrigine. This meets the criteria for Engel class IA - completely seizure-free since starting treatment. While she recently stopped taking lamotrigine on her own and has remained seizure-free for 2 months, this is still consistent with IA given the timeline. If she were to have another seizure, the score may change to IIA based on having rare disabling seizures after an initial seizure-free period. However, with the information provided, IA appears to be the appropriate score."

Diagnosis: Probable focal epilepsy
	   Migraine

Medication: start lamotrigine 25mg once a day, increasing by 25mg every 2 weeks up to 75mg BD

Thanks for asking me to review this 20-year-old lady who I reviewed alone. Her seizures started at the age of 5 before stopping and then reoccurring at the age of 16. They have continued since then and now she is having between 3 and 4 per week.

A typical seizure is consistent with a generalised tonic clonic seizure. Sometimes she has a warning of a difficult to describe sensation. She comes around feeling tired and achy. I spoke to her mum on the phone who says that her whole body goes stiff and jerks. She can make grunting noises and sometime her lips will turn blue.

Recently she has been having different types of episodes. These consist of loss of awareness. She will stare and look vacant for around 1 minute. Her mother said that sometimes she will fiddle with her hands. She is not taking any medicationa t the moment. She takes the oral contraceptive pill. There is a family history in that a maternal aunt has epilepsy. She works in a bar and doesn’t drive.

Her neurological examination today was normal

Impression.
Hannah has a focal epilepsy with a mixture of complex partial and secondary generalised seizures. I think it is worth updating her investigations and I have requested an MRI and EEG today.
She needs to be on an anti-epileptic medication and I recommend that she starts lamotrigine as detailed above.
We went over the driving regulations and she is aware she needs to be seizure free for a year before driving. We also discussed Sudden Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP)

I will see her in clinic in 6 months time.

",IIB,"The patient is having between 3-4 disabling seizures per week currently. This frequency of disabling seizures fits the criteria for Engel IIB - 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. Even though the patient has not had surgery, the instructions stated to assign a score ignoring whether the patient was post-surgery or not. The seizures are described as generalised tonic-clonic seizures and complex partial seizures, both of which would be considered disabling. There is no evidence of a period of being seizure-free for at least 2 years, so scores IA, IB, IC, and IIIB would not apply. There is also no mention of nocturnal seizures only or worthwhile seizure reduction, so scores IID and IIIA would not apply either. The frequency of 3-4 disabling seizures per week is too high for scores IIA, IIC, or IVB."

RE Mr Jason Trenchford D.O.B. 01/01/1970
 
Problems:          Three episodes of transient loss of consciousness
 
Diagnosis:          Epilepsy, probable focal onset
 
I reviewed this 49-year-old man together with his wife in clinic today.
 
On 6th NOvember last year Mr Trenchford remembers being in bed with vague memories of paramedics in his bedroom before clearly remembering waking up in hospital with a sore tongue. His arms and legs felt very achey for a few days afterwards ""like after the gym"". His wife said that around 7:30 in the morning she heard a loud groaning noise from the bedroom (she was in the bathroom). When she came in to the bedroom her husband was stiff and unconsciouss. His eyes were rolling and he was making unusual grunting noises. His arms and legs were shaking. This lasted about 2 mins. He was then in a deep sleep for several more minutes. He was agitated and confused when the paramedics came.
 
On 10th December whilst away with work he woke up in his hotel room alone with blood on the pillow and haven bitten his tongue. Again he felt slightly sore in his arms and legs afterwards.
 
Th third episode happened two weeks ago. This was witnessed by his wife and again happend when Mr Trenchford was asleep. It was very similar to the first episode.
 
He does have high blood pressure and COPD. He takes ramipril, simvastatin and inhalers. He has been smoking cigarettes since the age of 12 and drinks around 10 pints of pale ale each week. He works as a bricklayer and has a driving licence.
 
His birth was normal. He had have 3 febrile seizures between the age of 1 and 3. His Father's sister has epilepsy.
 
His neurological examination today was normal apart from slightly brisk reflexes in his legs and slight anisocria. His ECG and CT head from 2/1/19 was normal.
 
Impression. I do think that these episdoes are epileptic seizures and they are probably focal in onset. GIven that he has had at least three seizures he has epilepsy
 
I explained the diagnosis to Mr Trenchford and his wife. I explained that epilepsy is the tendency to have ongoing seizures (or electrical distrubances) in the brain
Seizures can ocassionally be dangerous and rarely cause death (Sudden death in epilepsy) and so I would advise treatment with an anti-seizure medication.
Please can you start lamotrigine 25mg once a day increasing by 25mg every fortnight until he is taking 75mg twice a day. I have enclosed an information sheet on lamotrigine with this letter. Lamotrigine is generally well tolerated but ocassionally can cause a rash which can be serious.
We went through the DVLA driving regulations. Mr Trenchford should inform the DVLA of the new diagnosis of epilepsy and cant drive until he has been at least one year free of seizures.
i will arrange and MRI and EEG and get back to you with the results


",IB,"The patient has had 3 seizure episodes over the past few months, indicating he is not completely seizure-free. However, the seizures are described as focal onset seizures without generalization. This fits the criteria for Engel class IB - non disabling simple partial seizures only since the presumed start of treatment. While we don't have confirmation he is on anti-seizure medication yet, the recommendation is made to start lamotrigine. So I am assuming the 'since surgery' component can be interpreted more broadly as since the presumed start of treatment to control his seizures."

I undertook a consultation with Tom, I also spoke with Tom’s partner with his permission. He is currently taking carbamazepine 400mg bd and levetiracetam 750mg bd.

Tom’s partner describes a bad patch, with 1-2 seizures occurring per day. Toom’s partner also says that Tom has become more irritable and aggressive recently.

I think that this mood change may be due to the levetiracetam. I therefore suggest that we change to brivaracetam, which has a lower incidence of mood problems.

This young lady returned to my clinic today accompanied by her mother. She reports having a single seizure some 3 weeks ago. This episode was very similar to the seizures she described previously, starting with the sensation of butterflies in her stomach followed by darkness, as if somebody turned off the lights, but no loss of consciousness. Her Mother confirmed that she is fully conscious during the episodes and in fact is able to communicate. 
Her EEG showed some minor temporal slowing but otherwise was reported as normal. She has not yest received her MRI appointment and I today agreed to chase it up. 
She is taking Lamotrigine 150 mg bd with no side effects. She says that on occasions she misses the dose. We discussed the importance of  good drug compliance. 
She reports that she had been stressed recently with her work and her studies. She has been asked to do extra shifts at work which then affects her course work and makes her stressed. She previously reported a sleep related movement disorder and we discussed this again today. It does not appear to be epileptic in nature and her sleep deprived EEG did not show any epileptic activity. 
She is not keen on seeking help from Mental Health Services regarding stress.

"Thank you for referring this forty-two year old gentleman whom I saw on behalf of the consultant today. He has a background history of hypertension and diabetes (controlled by insulin) for the last ten years. He was diagnosed with epilepsy ten years ago and his seizures were well controlled on lamotrigine. At the time of his diagnosis he had a MRI and EEG which were both normal. He stopped the lamotrigine of his own accord last year and this caused a reoccurance of his seizures. There were happening around twice per month before he reintroduced his lamotrigine. He tells me that the seizures consist of staring episodes where he loses awareness of his surrounding for a few mintues. He does know that there are about to happen as he gets an unusual sensation which is difficult to describe.

He also gets episodes of hypoglycaemia several times per week and he is not always aware of these. He does not check his blood sugar regularly although he does have a portable BM monitor. I wonder therefore if some of these episodes are hypoglycaemic. I have told him to monitor his blood sugars. I would be grateful also if his lamotrigine could be increased to 100mg twice a day (he is currently taking 75mg bd). I will also request an up to date EEG

",IIB,"The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since having his medication dosage reduced and then reintroduced. Specifically, the note states that before reintroducing lamotrigine, the patient was having seizures around twice per month. While the seizure frequency is not explicitly stated since restarting medication, there is no indication that the patient is completely seizure-free. He continues to have staring episodes where he loses awareness, which are likely focal impaired awareness seizures. Given that these seizures result in impairment/disability, they qualify as 'disabling seizures'. Since he restarted the lamotrigine, the frequency is implied to be less than the previous twice per month.

"Dear Dr ,
I reviewed this 42-year-old woman in the clinic this morning.  As you know she has experienced seizures since around 4 weeks after her operation.  This was a craniotomy for her frontal lobe brain tumour.  During her seizures she typically has a left-handed stiffness which progresses to her shoulder.  Around 50% of the time she will then lose consciousness before going in to  a bilateral convulsive seizure.
Her seizure frequency does vary.  Currently she get around 2-4 seizures per month.  Although she did have a cluster of seizures in August, 2017 where she had 6-9 seizures every week for 3 weeks.  She was born normally but did have 2 febrile seizures at the age of 2 months and 34 months.
She is currently taking levetiracetam 750 mg twice a day as well as lamotrigine 100 mg twice a day.  Her last MRI in January, 2018 did show frontal lobe gliosis and signs of previous craniotomy which would be consistent with her previous surgery.

There is no mention of a prolonged seizure-free period greater than 2 years, so scores IIIB and IIIC do not apply. The patient does not appear to fit criteria for scores IA, IB, IC, ID, IIA, IIC, IID, IIIA, IVA, IVB, or IVC."

He is getting on well with the epilim, he does not forget doses and does not get any side effects. He has ongoing problems with anxiety and depression as you know and he said that you are looking at treatment options for him here. As he is seizures free I have left him with an open appointment with us.

Diagnosis: Epilepsy - focal onset 
Medication: Currently Lamotrigine 75mg bd to increase over the following weeks to 125mg bd
 
We met Joan and her partner David today in the nurse lead clinic following her recent diagnosis of epilepsy. Her seizures began last year. Joan does not really remember what happens during a seizure. She has been told that she sees sees things that aren’t there and her speech is not normal. 
 
David says that she seems to panic, she may move her arms around start talking abnormally. After an event she will be confused and need to sleep. We discussed her diagnosis today in some detail. Her MRI has been reported as normal and she is awaiting an appointment for an EEG.
 
There are lots of resources available to help explain epilepsy in the family .We briefly discussed SUEDEP. We discussed that sharing a bed reduces the risk of SUDEP.
 
Joan says the seizure frequency is roughly every 4 weeks at present. We explained that this will become less over time as the medication is increased. She tells us that the Lamotrigine has helped her recover after seizures. She has a good support network, however her family are some distance away. Daniel is currently working from home and he is there to support her and the children. We also discussed contraception and I explained that the depo injection and lamotrigine can interact.
 
Another thing we discussed today is Joan’s mood. She has had a low mood for several years and has previously been prescribed sertraline. We discussed today how depression is common in epilepsy. We have advised today that it would be beneficial to consider an anti-depressant she feels in the past the sertraline was not of much use. Please could you arrange to her in regards to her mental health.
 
We have also explained to Joan that we run an open access service and we will not send her a routine follow up appointment with the epilepsy nurses. She knows that if she does need an appointment or need any support what so ever with her epilepsy she is free to call us whenever she wants.

",IIB,"The patient is having rare disabling seizures since the recent diagnosis of epilepsy and start of anti-epileptic drug treatment. Specifically, it is stated that 'Joan says the seizure frequency is roughly every 4 weeks at present.' Having a disabling seizure approximately once per month would be consistent with rare disabling seizures (Class II). There is no indication that she was initially seizure-free after starting treatment (IIA) or has been seizure-free for at least 2 years (IIC), so IIB (Rare disabling seizures since surgery) seems most applicable."

Dear Dr,

Re: 	Mrs Joan Jennings D.O.B.: 3/02/1992

Diagnosis: Temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to
	Herpes encephalitis (aged 20)

Current anti-epileptic medication:	eslicarbazepine 800mg od (to increase as detailed below)
				Folic acid 5mg od

TO start:	Clobazam as detailed below

Seizure type and frequency:	Focal to bilateral convulsive seizures around one every two months

Investigations: MRI April 2012, left temporal lobe hyperintensities consistent with encephalitis

I reviewed Mrs Jennings, together with her husband in clinic today. Her seizure frequency remains the same and she gets around one convulsive seizure every two months. They are sterotyped and she gets a feeling od deja-vu before they start. She lives with her husband, she is not currently working.

As you know her epilepsy was diagnosed in 2012. In this year she had herpes encephalitis and her epilepsy is a result of this.

We discussed the risks of ongoing convulsive seizures and the need for treatment. In the first instance I would suggest increasing the eslicarbazepine to 1200mg od. She can also use clobazam as required for seizure clusters.

We discussed the current DVLA driving regulations and issues around pregnancy should Mrs Jennings decide to have children.

I will review her in 8 months time but she can contact the epilepsy nurses before then should there be any issues.


",IIC,"The patient has focal to bilateral convulsive seizures around once every two months since having encephalitis in 2012. These seizures are disabling. The frequency of around once every 2 months is more than rare, but has been consistent for over 2 years since the encephalitis. This most closely matches the Engel IIC criteria."

I spoke to Hannah this morning in my telephone clinic. Increasing her tegretol has improved her seizures. Hannah thinks that she has had 2 seizures in the last five months which is good for her. Hannah becomes unresponsive during her seizures  before loosing consciousness. She does feel very tired after them.
 
We discussed safety and inparticualr taking a shower and not having a bath due to the rare but real risk of drowning. Hannah has explained her eplilepsy to her flat mate and understands basic first aid meaures. Currently Hannah doesn't drive.
 
I will arrange to see her in clinic in four months time but Hannah knows that she can contact us before then if theere are any issues.

Diagnosis:	Symptomatic structural epilepsy
		Right sided frontal meningioma (resectioned 2/6/2012)

Seizure type and frequency:	Partial motor seizures (left arm jerking)
				Complex partial seizures, several per month
				Secondary generalised seizures, last event October 2012

Current medication:		Levetiracetam 1500mg twice a day
				To introduce exlicarbazepine as detailed below

Investigations:			MRI 9/1/2014 – stable appearances of previous right frontal meningioma

I reviewed this 45-year-ol man in clinic today, he was accompanyied by his wife. As you know he had his first seizure in 2012 and was diagnosed with epilepsy on the same year. Brain imaging at the time picked up the meningioma which was operated on later in the year. He has continued to have sterotyped focal seizures which consist of left arm jerking. He gets an associated difficult to describe feeling in his arm. Around half of the time his awareness will be impaired during these episodes. He has not had any “big” (secondary generalised seizures) seizures since a few months after his operation.

Mr Jenkins also has depression and anxiety. You have recently started citalopram although he is not finding this very helpful. He lives with his wife and has not driven since the operation. He does not smoke but drinks about 10 pints of beer per week. This is no history of epilepsy in the family but he did have around 2 febrile seizures at the age of 8 months.

His recent MRI showed changes consistent with previous surgery in the right frontal lobe but no new changes.

Comments. Given that he is having ongoing seizures I would suggest changing the anti-epileptic medication to eslicarbazepine. Please start 400mg od, increasing be 400mg every week until he is taking 1200mg once a day. At the same time, please reduce the levetiracetam by500mg every week until it stops. Changing from the levetiracvetam to the eslicarbazepine should help his mood.
Thanks for organising a review with the community mental health team which I’m sure will be useful.
I will review again in a few months time.
",IIB,The patient has continued to have complex partial seizures and focal motor seizures involving his left arm several times per month since resection of a right frontal meningioma in June 2012.

Re          Mr William Williams	30/06/1957
 
Dear doctor,
 
I reviewed this 59 year old man with symptomatic structural epilepsy in clinic today. The cause of his epilepsy was a significant traumatic brain injury in 2006. As you know he had an accident whilst working on the farm and a piece of tractor equipment fell on his head, knocking him unconscious. He was admitted to the neurosurgical centre as he had a skull fracture and a traumatic sub arachnoid haemorrhage which was managed conservatively. 

He started having seizures in 2008 and was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2009. He gets complex partial seizures (deja-vu and orofacial automatsisms) as well as secondary generalised seizures. The complex partial seizures are now happening once a month, and he has around 1-2 secondary generalised seizures per year. He is taking levetiracetam 1500mg bd as well as lamotrigine 200mg bd and clobazam for seizure clusters (he takes this infrequently).

Since the accident Mr Williams has been getting flashbacks and feels low in mood. I would be very grateful if you could asses him for this. I would also suggest changing the levetiracetam to brivetiracetam 100mg bd. If he is still having seizures after this then I would suggest increasing the lamotrigine to 250mg bd in steps of 50mg every 2 weeks.

TO recap his investigations, he had a MRI of his brain a few years ago which was abnormal and shows some right fronto-temporal changes consistent with his previous brain injury. There are some focal epileptiform changes on his EEG from 2010, also in the right fronto/temporal areas.
Mr Williams lives with his wife and has stopped driving since the accident. He is happy to contact us via the epilepsy nurses should there be any issues. Otherwise we will review him in clinic in a few months.

",IIB,"The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since his traumatic brain injury and surgery. Specifically, he has complex partial seizures once a month and 1-2 secondary generalized seizures per year. This frequency of disabling seizures meets the criteria for Engel score IIB: 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'."
"Diagnosis: Refractory epilepsy
 
Medication:       Levetiracetam 1250mg bd
                             Lamotrigine 100mg bd
 
I reviewed this woman today in clinic. Since increasing the levetiracetam there has been no change in her seizure frequency. She has around 3-5 seizures a week.
 
In June her lamotrigine level was measured and was slightly high. She had a rash at the time but I am not sure if the lamotrigine caused this as she has been taking lamotrigine for several years. Her mood is not brilliant and she is finding that she is sleeping a lot in the day whilst being awake during the night.
 
We talked about some treatment options. I would advise switching the levetiracetam to brivetiracetam (100mg bd) this would be a straight switch. We also discussed some sleep hygiene measures and I have included a leaflet on some advice on sleeping. Also I would be grateful if you could prescribe melatonin 8mg on for 6 weeks to see if that improves the sleep cycle

",IVB,"The patient continues to have 3-5 seizures per week despite medication, with no appreciable change in seizure frequency even after an increase in her levetiracetam dose. This indicates no worthwhile improvement in seizures, meeting criteria for Class IVB on the Engel scale."
"Dear Dr.

I reviewed this 42 year old lady with epilepsy, together with her husband, in clinic today. She tells me that she has been getting episodes around twice a week of an unusual thought. This was difficult to describe but it was like an overfamiliar or déjà vu feeling. These thoughts last for around 30 seconds. I think these are in keeping with temporal lobe onset focal seizures. This is interesting as previously she was getting events with coloured objects in her field of vision which were probably occipital lobe seizures.

Currently she is taking sodium valproate 500 mg twice a day and levetiracetam 1000 mg twice today. She has previously tried carbamazepine but this give her a rash. I explained the new MHRA rules on prescribing sodium valproate in women of child bearing age. Even though Mrs Williams has no plans for further children, rules stated that we should try an alternative medication given that she does not want to use a secure form of contraception. We had a discussion about the various risks and benefits of stopping sodium valproate. She should slowly reduce the sodium valproate by 200 mg every week. At the same time, she should introduce lamotrigine at 25 mg every day, increasing by 25 mg every fortnight, to a target dose of 75 mg twice a day.

We also had a discussion about sudden death in epilepy (SUDEP). Overall this is rare, it is if real risk with people all continue to get seizures. We discussed things that can reduce the risk of SUDEP. These include not forgetting medication and controlling seizures. I will review Mrs Williams again in four months time.

",IIB,"The patient is currently experiencing focal seizures with an unusual thought sensation occurring around twice per week. These seizures are not fully controlled with medication, indicating that the patient has rare disabling seizures since the unspecified treatment, meeting criteria for Engel IIB. While the seizures were previously more frequent and of a different semiology (visual occipital lobe seizures), the note does not provide enough information to determine if those seizures have completely resolved or just reduced in frequency. Overall, the description of current seizures occurring around twice weekly with unchanged medications aligns closest with an Engel IIB classification."

Many thanks for referring this 47 year old gentleman who I saw alone in clinic today. The events have been going on now for around 9 months. He has suffered around 10 events in total. He has not had any for the last 2 weeks. They seemed to be associated with him cutting down his alcohol intake suddenly.
 
There has been no warning for the episodes and they have not been witnessed. During one episode he felt himself shaking. He has come around from an attack having spilt his drink.
 
He has not had any febrile seizures and there is no history of significiant head injuries or intracranial infections. He is unemployed and is not driving. He currently drinks around 500ml of whiskey per day having cut this down from 1litre previously. His neurological examination was normal apart from some mild gait ataxia.
 
Impression. This man has had a number of unwitnessed episodes of loss of consciousness in the context of reducing his alcohol intake. I have explained the DVLA regulations on driving and will arrange an MRI scan of his brain as well as an ECG.

",IVB,"The patient could potentially be assigned a score of IVB - No appreciable change. He has had around 10 episodes of unwitnessed loss of consciousness over 9 months. There are no details provided on seizure frequency before this 9 month period to determine if there has been an appreciable change. Additionally, there is no mention of the patient having a diagnosis of epilepsy, being on anti-seizure medications, or undergoing epilepsy surgery to determine outcome.

I reviewed this gentleman with a primary generalised epilepsy in clinic this morning. He is on Epilim 300 mg in the morning and 600 mg in the evening and carbamazepine 300mg bd.

Unfortunately he forgot to take his normal dose of carbamazepine last week and had a generalised tonic clonic seizure. He last had a seizure before this around a year ago.

Re          Mr Owen Owens	30/06/1968
 
Dear doctor,

Diagnosis: Symptomatic structural focal epilepsy
		Area of ischaemic damage left inferior frontal lobe
		Significant anxiety and depression
 
I reviewed this 50 year old man, together with his wife, in clinic today. He was well from an epilepsy point of view until he had a seizure last month. His wife heard a bang from the next room and went in to see him unconsciouss on the floor. He was stiff, his eyes were open and he made unusual groaning noises before starting to shake. This lasted about 40 seconds before he went to a “deep sleep”. It took him several hours to recover fully. Mr Owens himself remembers his right leg twitching before he lost consciousness. I think therefore that this was a focal to bilateral convulsive seizures. As you recall Mr Owens has had focal motor seizures in the past where he has had jerking of his right leg. These were happening frequently before he started the medication. The last event was probably 10 months ago. He has had one previous focal to bilateral convulsive seizure at the time of diagnosis of his epilepsy in May 2017. As you will recall his MRI at the time was abnormal with an area of ischaemic damage in the left inferior frontal lobe. This is the probable cause of his epilepsy. An EEG in 2017 did show some left sided sharp waves.

He is currently taking lamotrigine 75mg twice a day and given the recent seizure I would be very grateful if you could increase this by 25mg every fortnight to 100mg twice a day. It can be increased further if necessary in a similar way. Previously he tried levetiracetam but this made his mood worse.

Mr Owens has ongoing problems with his mood and finds it very difficult to leave the house. He has found anti-depressants useful in the past and I would be very grateful if you could reassess him from his mental health point of view. There is no contraindication to treatment with anti-depressants if necessary.
Mr Owens is still managing to work as an accountant and he is aware of the DVLA driving regulations. He is currently drinking around 40units of alcohol a week. We had a chat about the effects of alcohol and I would advise that he reduces his intake to the recommended 14 units of alcohol per week with a few alcohol free days.
I will ask the epilepsy nurses to review again. 
Yours

",IIA,"The patient had been seizure-free for 10 months after starting medication, meeting the criteria for being initially free of disabling seizures after surgery/treatment. However, he recently had a focal to bilateral convulsive seizure, which is considered a rare disabling seizure. This fits the IIA criteria of being initially seizure-free but having rare seizures now. There is no evidence of worthwhile seizure reduction that would meet Class III criteria, and no evidence of seizures being worse to meet Class IV criteria. Therefore, based on having rare disabling seizures after an initial seizure-free period, the score of IIA is most appropriate."

It was lovely to speak with Joan and her partner today in the nurse led clinic. They gave me a very good description of her seizures. They come on suddenly, sometimes with a distinctive, difficult to describe, smell of disinfectant. Last month, Joan had a cluster of 5 seizures within two days. This is unusual as before this her seizures have been relatively well controlled. Joan does have some stress in her life at the moment which might have been a provoking factor for her seizures.
 
As Joan does not have any side effects from the medication then it would be reasonable to increase her lamotrigine as above. We would appreciate your support in this change of medication. Joan has an open appointment in this clinic and can contact us at anytime should there be any problems with her epilepsy.

Dear doctor,

Thank you for referring this 44-year-old lady to neurology. She has seen other neurologists in the past. She has been suffering from epilepsy since her birth.

At the moment she gets 2 types of seizures:
1. Blank episodes. These occur without warning can last for up to 5 minutes. She is unaware of her surroundings. These happen at least once per day.
2. Grand mal seizures. These happen a few times a month. During these she will shake all over. She occasionally will bite the side of her tongue. 

She has tried sodium valproate in the past but stopped this because of tremor and gum problems. She also tried levetiracetam but stopped this because of mood problems.  Currently she takes clobazam 20mg bd and lamotrigine 175mg bd. Her co-morbidities include depression and chronic pain syndrome. She takes pregabalin and MST for the pain.

She was told that she was born unexpectedly outside hospital and was still born. I do not have any other information about this with me today. Previous EEGs and MRIs have been normal. She has not had any significant head injuries or febriles seizures. There is no history of epilepsy in the family.

IN the first instance I have requested an up to date EEG and I will also review her old medical notes. I have asked her to keep a seizures diary and get her partner to take some videos of the events. I will review her in clinic.

Yours

I reviewed this 45-year old man in epilepsy clinic today. His wife also attended. He has had episodes for 6 years now. They happen about 1-2 per month and are always the same. There is no obvious trigger to them. In the episodes he gets a difficult to describe “familiar memory”, its like dejavu. They last a few seconds. He can hear people during them but it is difficult to speak properly.
 
His wife said that during them he will look uncomfortable and will stare a bit. He wont move at all and there are no limb movements.
 
He has never had an episode of loss of consciousness and has no other medical problems apart from episodic migraine for what he takes aspirin and sumitriptan. He works as a teacher, drives a car and lives with his wife and two children. He smokes and drinks around 20 units of alcohol per week.
 
He was born prematurely at 34 weeks weighing 4.5 pounds. He has not had febrile seizures, significant cerebral infections or head injuries. His father’s brother had epilepsy as a child.
 
His neurological examination was normal today apart from slightly brisk lower limb reflexes.
 
I think that these sterotyped brief epsiodes are focal seizures with altered awareness and that gives the diagnosis of epilepsy.

",IIB,"The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since the onset of his epilepsy 6 years ago, at a frequency of 1-2 per month. This fits the criteria for an Engel score of IIB: 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. Though it is not clearly stated if he has had surgery, the instructions specify to ignore that aspect and assign a score based solely on seizure frequency and impact. With 1-2 disabling seizures per month ongoing for the past 6 years, class I ('Free of disabling seizures') would not apply. Class IIA also would not apply since he has not had a period of being initially seizure-free. The seizures are disabling based on the description that he is unable to speak properly during them. Therefore, IIB appears to be the best fit score."

Dear doctor,

Diagnosis: Focal epilepsy secondary to
                                Traumatic brain injury
                                Chronic daily headache
 
Recommendations: Please start lamotrigine as detailed below
                                Follow up in 6 months
                                Limit simple analgesia to help with headache
 
I reviewed this 42-year-old lady in clinic. She has previously seen other epilepsy consultants and the epilepsy nurse. As you know she was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2012 following a severe traumatic brain injury where she fell down 12 flights of stairs, had traumatic contusions and a tramatuic sub dural haemorrhage. Last year she had around 15 generalised tonic clonic seizures. She is also having small attacks where she stares, has speech arrest and may smack her lips. I think that these are complex partial seizures. She is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg twice a day. She gets chronic daily headache and takes at least 8 co-codamol tablets a day to try and help with this.
 
As you know Alice used to work as a teaching assistant and is very keen to return to work in the long term. She wants to get better seizure control to achieve this. It seems like Alice’s epilepsy control is suboptimal. She still has some mood problems and so I would not increase the levetiracetam more. Please can you start lamotrigine 25mg once a day increasing by 25mg every fortnight until she is taking 100mg bd. This should help both the epilepsy and mood. She is also taking olanzopine and it seems reasonable to reduce this slowly.

Yours

Dear doctor,
 
I reviewed this 48 year old gentleman for thi first time in clinic today.
 
As you know he had 3 febrile seizures between the ages of 3 and 5 and then started developing focal onset seizures from the age of 6.
They continued until his surgery a few years ago. I was very pleased to note that he remains seizure free after his surgery. Before the surgery he was having seizures several times a week despite having tried many medications which have included carbmazapine, levetiracetam and zonisamide. The lamotrigine has had the most effect of the years and he has tolerated this medication the best.
 
He was born normally and had a normal development having left school with three A-levels. I am pleased to note that he has returned to his job with the insurance company and has also started driving lessons.
 
We had a discussion about the medication and that any reduction in the medication runs the risk of seizure reoccurance. At the moment Mr Williams is happy to continue to take the medication as he does not have any side effects.
 
Yours

"Dear Dr,

I reviewed this 42 year old gentleman with epilepsy after a previous significant head injury in clinic today. His brother was also with him. Currently he is taking carbamazepine 300 mg BD. He also takes gabapentin 300 mg tds. His brother said that he has had three generalised tonic clonic seizures and more of his typical absences since the last clinic appointment. We did have a chat about changing his medication today but he was reluctant to do this. I will review him again in four months time.
",IVB,"The patient continues to have disabling seizures including three generalized tonic-clonic seizures and more typical absences since his last appointment. There is no mention of any worthwhile seizure reduction or prolonged seizure-free intervals. He continues to require anti-epileptic medications to try to control his seizures. Therefore, this would be classified as Class IVB on the Engel Scale - no appreciable change in his seizure control."
"Thank you for referring this patient who I saw in clinic today. She says that she’s had jerks while travelling in a car when light flickers through passing trees. In June last year she was in a party when lights were flashing. As the light flashed she lost consciousness. when she came round she had bitten both sides of her tongue quite badly. Friends said that she was shaking for a minute. She’s not had any further episodes of transient loss of consciousness but she still gets occasional jerks with flashing lights.

She does not have any other past medical history. There is no family history of epilepsy.

Neurological examination was normal.

I suspect this lady has epilepsy. I will arrange further tests including an MR brain and EEG and review her with the results.

",IVC,"The patient is having occasional jerks with flashing lights, indicating she is still having some seizures, though the details and frequency are unclear. She does not appear to have achieved worthwhile improvement or prolonged seizure freedom. As she still seems to be experiencing disabling seizures, though less severe than her initial event, this would be classified as Class IV - No worthwhile improvement, with subclass IVC - Seizures worse."

Many thanks for referring this 28 year old gentleman was previously seen by Prof Davis. His epilepsy started at the age of 14. History is consistent with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presenting with generalised tonic clonic seizures, absences and myoclonic jerks.

In the past he has tried lamotrigine and topiramate without any good therapeutic benefit. There has been significant stress and anxiety in the last year.

We discussed changing his medication. Sodium valproate is the best medication for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Mr Jones can try more clobazam when he gets clusters of myoclonic jerks. I will ask the epilepsy specialist nurses to contact him.

",IIB,"The patient has a diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and is on sodium valproate and clobazam. There is no clear information on current seizure frequency or severity. Based on the medications prescribed, it seems the patient continues to have some seizures, possibly myoclonic jerks, which would fit a score of IIB (rare disabling seizures since surgery). However, without more details on seizures, other scores like IIIA (worthwhile seizure reduction) or IVB (no appreciable change) cannot be ruled out."

Thank you for referring this 41-year-old administrator to my clinic. For the last 10 months he has been having déjà vu episodes which are associated with nausea and an odd taste in his mouth. The episodes are short, lasting less than a minute, and he is fully aware throughout. Present frequency is 4 to 5 episodes a month. 

His birth was normal. There is no history of febrile seizures, brain infections, or head injury. There is no family history of epilepsy. He is generally fit and well.

His neurological examination today was totally normal.

His EEG which was done last November is reported as mildly abnormal,  containing bi-temporal irregular slow activity. There was no frank epileptiform activity seen.
He is still awaiting an MRI examination.

The episodes are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. 
He should be started on Carbamazepine 200md bd.
I will review him in my clinic following his MRI examination.

		Epilepsy
		Depression

Current medication:	Carbamazepine 600mg bd
			Brivetiracetam 50mg bd
			Clobazam 5mg bd
			Sertraline

Previous medications include: Levetiracetam, sodium valproate

I reviewed this 48-year-old man by telephone consultation today. He has previously seen other neurologists in the past and has ongoing episodes. There are two main different types of episodes. 1) He will get “grand mal” episodes which happen without warning. There are no witness descriptions of these events, previously he has injured himself during these attacks and he has been told he will shake all over. He has had around 6 of these during the last year. During them he is aware of his surroundings and can hear people. They can last up to 20 minutes.
2) He also gets “mini shakes” these are like electric shocks where his arms and legs might jerk. These happen a few times every month.

He lives alone and also has a diagnosis of depression. His family live close by. He doesn’t drive, smokes around 20 cigarettes a day and drinks ocassional alcohol only. A recent MRI and EEG in 2018 have been normal. During the EEG he did have several jerk like episodes which were not accompanied by any EEG changes and so would be consistent with dissociative seizures.

I think it would be useful to capture some of these seizures on videotelemetry and so I will request some videotelemetry today. I will review his old notes. I will request a face to face clinic review with the results of the above.

I reviewed Simon in clinic today, together with his brother. I was pleased to hear that he remains seizure free and is driving again. When he tried to stop it a few years ago his seizures came back.
 
We had a discussion about changing the medication or withdrawing the medication completely. Simon knows about the seizure reoccurrence risk of reducing his medication and the fact that he would need to stop driving for six months whilst this is taking place. He wonders whether the tiredness is something to do with his carbamazepine although I note that this is long standing.

I spoke with John today in the epilepsy nurse clinic. He hasn't had any seizures now for around three weeks which is good news. We had a chat about memory and epilepsy. John finds that his memory is poor and it is difficult for him to remembr things. We discussed some things that can help memory e.g. writing things down and scrap books.

",IIIB,"The patient has been seizure-free for 3 weeks. This does not meet the criteria for Class I (completely seizure-free since surgery) or Class II (rare disabling seizures). A 3 week seizure-free period is also less than 2 years, so does not meet the criteria for Class IIC or IIIB. However, a 3 week seizure-free period could be considered a 'prolonged seizure-free interval amounting to greater than half the follow-up period'. Since the follow-up period is not clearly defined but seems relatively short based on the notes, this prolonged 3 week seizure-free interval could potentially meet the criteria for Class IIIB. Therefore, I have assigned an Engel score of IIIB."

CVA	with right hemiparesis 2017

Medication : simvastatin, Aspirin

I saw this 52 year old gentleman together With his partner in clinic today. He had an event on 22 December. He was sitting on the sofa when he developed shaking of the right arm. This continued for three minutes. The movements did not become generalised. It took him around four minutes to recover during which time his partner noticed that he had some lip smacking.

He has not had any the previous seizures. Apart from the previous stroke, he is well. He lives with his partner and is currently a teacher and has stopped driving. He gave up smoking 10 years ago and he drinks three cans of lager every week.

On examination he had a right hemiparesis. ECG was normal. There was a previous CT scan from 2017 showing a left hemisphere infarct

Impression

This history is consistent with a single focal seizure secondary to a known stroke. We discussed the following: 
· I will request an MRI of the brain
· We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of starting antiepileptic medication. I explained that even though he’s only had one seizure he is at risk of further seizures. Currently he would prefer to hold off medication.
· I explained the driving regulations. He needs to be clear of all seizures for 12 months before he can resume driving.
· If you went on to have another seizure or if he decided to start medication then I would suggest maybe Levetiracetam 250 mg once-a-day, increasing by 250 mg every two weeks to 250 milligrams twice a day. The main side effects are tiredness, and mood change.

",IID,"The patient had a single focal seizure likely related to his previous stroke. He has not had any seizures prior to this event. The seizure was focal in nature, involving shaking of the right arm and some lip smacking, without generalization. This would be classified as a nocturnal seizure under the Engel criteria. While not explicitly stated, the description of the event occurring while sitting on the sofa implies the seizure happened at a time when the patient would normally be awake and active, meeting the nocturnal classification. With only a single seizure occurring so far, there is no evidence of rare or frequent disabling seizures, worthwhile improvement, or worsening at this time. Therefore, the score of IID - Nocturnal seizures only, is most applicable."

I revealed this 42 year old lady together with her husband in clinic today. In March she had 2 to 3 of her focal seizures without change in awareness. Since her last clinic appointment she has had four secondary generalised seizures. During her focal seizures she may have a strange taste and an unusual sensation in her tummy. She will have a change in awareness and would find it difficult to respond. She also gets the same sensations before one of her have bigger convulsive seizures.

We had a discussion about changing medication but Mrs Williams was not keen on changing things today. This was despite me reminding her of the ongoing risk of convulsive seizures.

We revealed her previous MRI scan in 2012. It does show a subtle high intensity signal in the left temporal lobe and I think it would be useful to get a repeat MRI scan to quantify this further. I will ask the epilepsy nurse to contact Mrs Williams in a few months time and I will see her again in this clinic in six months time.

This indicates there has been no appreciable reduction in her seizures, meeting criteria for an Engel score of IVB (No appreciable change).

"Problem: 2 episodes of transient loss of consciousness

Diagnosis: genetic generalised epilepsy

I reviewed this 23-year-old woman together with her mother in the consultant’s clinic today. She remembers coming home from the office (she works for an insurance company) in the afternoon. She remembers telling her mother that she didn’t feel right before loosing consciousness and then waking up in hospital. She had bitten her tongue and had muscles aches in her arms and legs the next day.

Her mother was able to describe the event in more detail. She sad that she went stiff, gave out a shout before falling to the floor and convulsing for about a minute. She had a previous similar event around 8 months ago.

There is no history of events resembling focal seizures, absences or myoclonus. She was born prematurely at 32 weeks weighing 5lbs. She did not have febrile seizures, significant cerebral infections or significant head injuries. She has already started taking lamotrigine (current dose is 50mg twice a day) and does not take any other medication apart from the oral contraceptive pill.

Charlotte did have a driving licence before these event but has surrounded it to the DVLA after informing them of the diagnosis. She drinks alcohol with her friends on the weekend but does not smoke. Her neurological examination and ECG was normal in clinic today.

An MRI brain performed last month was normal. An EEG from May shows paroxysms of generalised spike and wave activity but no photosensitivity.

Impression. I think that the two events of loss of consciousness were generalised tonic-clonic seizures. This, together with the abnormal EEG mean that there is a diagnosis of epilepsy, namely genetic generalised epilepsy.

In the evening this suddenly got worse and then he lost consciousness suddenly. When he came round, he was on the floor with severe tongue pain and a headache. He had bitten the side of his tongue. He had some arms and leg pain for several days afterwards. He was on his own at the time that this happened and so there is no witness history.
 
With hindsight he might have had some jerks in the past but there is no real convincing evidence of myoclonus or clinical photosensitivity. He was born normally and had one febrile seizure. He is currently working as a software engineer and doesnt drive. His mother used to have childhood absence seizures but she is now seizure free on medication.

I reviewed Huw in clinic today. He has only recently increased the Zonisamide to the current dose. Huw’s partner wondered if there had been a slight reduction in seizure frequency.
Huw has had more frequent and different seizures. These consist of prolonged bilateral episodes of limb shaking with retained awareness. Sometimes these have lasted 1-2 hours. These have coincided with increases in stress and I wonder if these could be non epileptic rather than epileptic seizures given their prolonged duration.
Having said this I have no doubt that Huw also has epileptic seizures and so I would suggest increasing the zonisamide to 150mg twice a day in the first instance. There is an option to add in perampanel as well if the zonsiamide isn’t effective.

",IIB,"The patient is described as having 'more frequent and different seizures' consisting of 'prolonged bilateral episodes of limb shaking with retained awareness.' While the duration makes the neurologist wonder if these could be non-epileptic seizures, he notes that the patient definitely also has epileptic seizures. So there is evidence of continued disabling seizures, though details on exact frequency are not provided. This fits the IIB criteria of 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery.'

He has also had “staring” episodes according to his girlfriend where he looks into space. There is no history of myoclonic jerks. He has had several superficial head injuries whilst playing rugby and he may have had a febrile seizure at the age of 6 months. There is no other relevant history and no family history.

Dear Dr Jones,

I reviewed this lady with intractable epilepsy in clinic today. She is on Keppra 1000 mg BD, Zonisamide 125 mg BD. Despite this she continues to get general and complex partial seizures. She’s not very keen on her anticonvulsant medication. She continues to get chronic daily headaches. There is a postural variation in her headache and I wonder if she has spontaneous intracranial hypotension I am therefore arranging an MRI scan of the brain.

Would you be able to prescribe some sedation before the MRI scan appointment?

I will review again in five months time.

Yours sincerely,

Dr Baker

",IVB,"The note states the patient continues to have general and complex partial seizures despite medications, but provides no further detail on seizure frequency or severity. This suggests there has been no appreciable change or worthwhile improvement in seizures, fitting the criteria for score IVB."
"I saw this 19 year old lady in my clinic today. She is feeling well and has not had any further seizures. She’s not experiencing any side-effects on the levetiracetam 500 milligrams twice a day. I will not change things and I will see again in 12 months time.
",IA,The patient is reported to be completely seizure-free since starting levetiracetam treatment 12 months ago. She has not had any further seizures and is not experiencing any medication side effects. This meets the criteria for Engel Class IA - completely seizure-free since starting treatment.
"Diagnosis: generalised tonic chronic seizures, absences and myoclonic jerks since teenage years,?JME.

Medication: lamotrigine 150 milligrams twice a day
Keppra 1000 milligrams twice a day

The epilepsy started as a teenager and the history is suggestive of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy given that she had an EEG with spike, polyspike and wave activity.

Her epilepsy is currently reasonably controlled on the increased dose of lamotrigine. She doesn’t complain of any side-effects of this dose. Keppra was tried on a bigger dose of 1500 mg twice a day in the past which gave her dizziness. A follow-up has been arranged.

",IIB,"The patient is described as having 'reasonably controlled' epilepsy on medication, with no mention of surgery. This suggests there has been worthwhile improvement in seizure control, but the patient still experiences some breakthrough disabling seizures, though they seem to be rare ('reasonably controlled'). As such, an Engel score of IIB ('Rare disabling seizures since surgery') seems most appropriate even though the patient has not undergone surgery."
"I reviewed this 36-year-old lady in clinic.  She had a mild sub-arachnoid haemorrhage around 12 years ago.  She continues to get a combination of epileptic and nonepileptic events which was confirmed with an EEG recording.

Medication: Carbamazepine 200mg twice a day


Thank you for referring this 41-year-old administrator to my clinic. For the last 10 months he has been having déjà vu episodes which are associated with nausea and an odd taste in his mouth. The episodes are short, lasting less than a minute, and he is fully aware throughout. Present frequency is 4 to 5 episodes a month. 

His birth was normal. There is no history of febrile seizures, brain infections, or head injury. There is no family history of epilepsy. He is generally fit and well.

His neurological examination today was totally normal.

His EEG which was done last November is reported as mildly abnormal,  containing bi-temporal irregular slow activity. There was no frank epileptiform activity seen.
He is still awaiting an MRI examination.
Comments:
The episodes are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. 
He should be started on Carbamazepine 200md bd.
I will review him in my clinic following his MRI examination. 

Yours Sincerely,
",IIIA,"The patient has not undergone epilepsy surgery, so post-surgical Engel criteria do not directly apply. However, he is experiencing focal seizures 4-5 times per month that cause déjà vu, nausea, and an odd taste.

Re: Ms Rachel Smith

Medical diagnosis:	Generalised epilepsy with absences and GTCS

Medication	Lamotrigine	100 mg in the morning
		Levetiracetam 250mg twice a day (increase by 250mg every fortnight to 500mg twice a day)

I met with Rachel and her mother today in clinic. She is now nearly fifteen years of age.

To recap, Rachel started having absence seizures at around the age of 8. These were relatively infrequent and were worse when she was tired. She had her first generalised tonic clonic seizure at the age of 12. After this she was started on the lamotrigine. She has had relatively frequent tonic clonic seizures in the last few years, perhaps every two months or so. Seizures normally coincide with sleep deprivation. The seizure frequency has improved after starting the levetiracetam. The absences continue to happen maybe every week, again they are more common after sleep deprivation.

An EEG last year did show some generalised spike and wave without any photosensitivity or focal features. She also had a normal MRI of her brain last year.

We decided to increase the levetiracetam as it has helped things as per the plan above. We will continue to review in this clinic before she moves to the adult clinic.

Yours
",IIC,"The patient continues to have disabling absence seizures about once a week. She has also had rare GTCS, about every 2 months, after initial seizure freedom on levetiracetam.

Re: Ms Helen Harris

Diagnosis		Temporal lobe epilepsy
			Anxiety
			Non epileptic attack disorder

Current medication	Lamotrigine 100 mgms bd
			Pregabalin 75 mgms bd

Follow up		Four months.

I was pleased to meet Helen and her father in clinic today. She has not had any collapses now for around 6 months. Her anxiety has got worse with some family issues at home and some upcoming exams. With her increasing anxiety she can get periods of “absences” where she feels “distant” and gets a funny feeling in her toes.

We had a chat about these episdoes and they are probably more anxiety related than seizures. They also may be non-epileptic attacks which are more common in people with epilepsy.

Helen sometimes forgets to take her lamotrigine but the pregabalin helps her anxiety quite a bit and so she takes that more often. As Helen is now sixteen we discussed moving to the adult clinic and I will refer her to the transisition clinic. I will also ask CAMHS to see her given the problems with anxiety.
",ID,"The patient has been seizure-free for 6 months, indicating she is free of disabling seizures. The note mentions she sometimes forgets to take her anti-epileptic medication lamotrigine, but does not state she has had seizures as a result. Her main issues currently appear to be anxiety-related symptoms like absences and non-epileptic attacks. Therefore, the criteria for Engel class 1D - 'Generalized convulsions with antiepileptic drug withdrawal only' seems most applicable, as she is currently seizure-free but could be at risk for seizures if she stops her medication completely."

I have spoken with Darren today he tells me that he usually receives Accord Lamotrigine 200mg to be
taken twice daily, but, this month he has been given an alternative brand. Darren, as is usual for him,
decided to do as directed and take the Lamotrigine but he has found that it is having some odd side
effects for him such as dizziness and is a little unsteady on his feet and a little slurred with his speech.
In face he tells me that his friend remarked that he thought that he had been drinking. Darren does not drink alcohol and therefore he was a little curious as to why this should be. 

We have discussed this today and we would ask that you would kindly consider prescribing specifically Accord Lamotrigine for Darren in the future. He is going to continue to take his Lamotrigine as prescribed but we would really appreciate your attention to this matter as soon as you are able to replace the existing Lamotrigine with Accord brand.

It is well documented that Lamotrigine can be susceptible to differences according to different brands, with this in mind it is not unreasonable that Darren is finding an alternative brand difficult to take. Darren will remain in contact with the team and he knows we are here to support him should it be necessary.

Yours sincerely

",III,"There is no clear information provided on the patient's seizure frequency before or after medication changes. The note suggests the patient has previously had good seizure control on his usual Accord Lamotrigine, as changing brands results in side effects and comments from others about appearing intoxicated. This suggests the patient likely has had 'worthwhile seizure reduction' from medications in the past, meeting criteria for Class III. However, without explicit details on seizures, this score is highly speculative."

Current anti-seizure medication:              Lamotrigine 50mg bd
 
Investigations: MRI and EEG normal 2018
 
Thank you for asking us to review this 23-year-old gentleman who I reviewed by telephone consultation today. You had seen him as a ward referral when he was admitted to hospital.
 
He’s had episodes of transient loss of consciousness since the age of 17. During these episodes he has injured himself, including having bitten his tongue. Before these episodes he will get a strange feeling in his stomach where it will “turn in on itself”. He can also get these sensations by themselves. He has taken recreational drugs in the past such as amphetamine but these episdoes have occurred unprovoked. I think that these represent focal epileptic seizures
 
There is no significant family history apart from his grandfather having a few seizures in the context of a febrile illness. He has been knocked unconscious twice in the past when he has been involved in fights.
 
Since you have started him on the lamotrigine he has not had any further episdoes. He does have some reflux for which he takes lansoprazole and he also takes citalopram for low mood.
 
You thought that his neurological examination was normal and I note the normal investigations.
 
I explained the diagnosis of epilepsy to Mr Terazzo, it is relatively common and causes seizures which can be thought of as electrical disturbances in the brain. Rarely seizures can be dangerous and can cause serious injury or even death.
If Mr Terazzo were to have further seizures then I would in the first instance increase the lamotrigine by 25mg every fortnight.

I reviewed this 62 year old man in clinic with his daughter today. He has had epilepsy since the age of four. His epilepsy has generally been very well-controlled. He has had a convulsive seizure approximately every five years. He has previously been taking phenytoin but has stopped taking this.

Recently he has had different events. They tend to occur in the bathroom. He recalls an event last month. He got out of bed and went to the bathroom, he felt hot and lightheaded and the next thing he knows his waking up on the bathroom floor having been incontinent. His wife recalls  another event in February. She heard a bang from the bathroom and found him on the floor. He was unconscious but recovered within 20 seconds. He remembers feeling sick with muffled hearing before this event. These events do seem to be different to his usual seizures.

He is a retired plumber, he has been smoking for 20 years. He drinks seven pints of medium dry cider per week. His father died at 61 from chest disease. He was born prematurely weighing less than 3 pounds. He was born at home and then taken to hospital. He has never had meningitis.

Things are quite stable from an epilepsy point of view.  As you know he is taking 150 mg of lamotrigine twice a day.  His last seizures were in his teenage years where he probably had around 3 or 4 focal to bilateral convulsive seizures.  There were some perinatal problems and he was born to a long and traumatic labour.  He had to spend around 2 weeks in Special care baby Unit.  He had 4 febrile seizures at the age of 3, 4 and then around five.  He had some viral meningitis when he was in his late teenage years while he was doing a levels.
 
He had an MRI brain performed in 2016. This does show some left-sided cortical and deep white matter changes which are probably representative of a perinatal insult.

Dear Dr Jones,

I reviewed this lady with intractable epilepsy. She is on Keppra 1250 mg twice a day, Zonisamide 125 mg twice a day. Epilepsy is about the same. She continues to get occasional seizures and has temple tenderness. I am therefore arranging for a CT scan of the brain and CRP to look for evidence of temporal arthritis.

I would be grateful if you could replace the duloxetine with gabapentin 300 mg tds increasing to 600 mg 3 to 4 times per day.

I will review again,

Yours sincerely,

Dr Baker

I reviewed this 37 year old lady together with her husband in clinic today. She has had seizures since the age of 13. At present her epilepsy is the best it’s ever been. She has seizures every 3 to 4 weeks. Her diabetes is a little out of control at present with high blood sugars.

Before her seizures she has a warning of an unusual taste. I was unable to get a detailed description of her seizures today.

We had a chat about previous options and at present Mrs Evans wanted to keep things as they were. That is an option to increase the levetiracetam by 250 mg every fortnight to a new target dorsal of 1000 mg twice a day if necessary.

I will update her investigations by requesting an EEG and MRI and will also review her old notes. I will see her in clinic in three months time.



",IIB,"The patient is reported to have seizures every 3-4 weeks. This frequency would be considered 'rare disabling seizures' according to the Engel scale criteria. Specifically, Category IIB indicates 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. Although it is not stated whether the patient has had surgery, the instructions specify to ignore this aspect. With seizures occurring approximately once a month, this frequency fits the 'rare' designation better than Categories III or IV which require seizure-free intervals greater than half the follow-up period or no appreciable change, respectively. Therefore, based on the seizure frequency reported, I have assigned this patient an Engel score of IIB."

Re: Mr Jason Spirits	D.O.B. 18/08/1949

I reviewed this 65 year old man in clinic today. As you know he has symptomatic structural temporal lobe epilepsy caused by his previous herpes encephalitis. He is currently taking carbamazepine (Tegretol retard) 400mg twice a day as well as sodium valproate 400mg twice a day.

Jason has been having some problems with anxiety recently and I note that you have started him on sertraline for this which seems to have helped a bit. In terms of his epilepsy, things are relatively stable. His sister (who was with him in clinic today) said that he has had around 5 seizures in the last year which is good for him. Jason gets focal seizures with altered awareness where he will have an abnormal sensation on the right side of his body and then find it difficult to talk. He might pick at his clothes during these according to his sister.

We had a chat about the cause of his epilepsy which happened because of his nasty encephalitis infection a few years ago (herpes encephalitis). We discussed various treatment options and it may be worth increasing the carbamazepine slightly to help with the seizures and the anxiety. I would increase it to 600mg in the morning and 400mg in the evening and then to 600mg bd after a few weeks if tolerated.

We will keep Jason under review in this clinic

Re: 	Iestyn Parry	D.O.B. 11/07/1950

Problem:	Transient loss of consciousness

Diagnosis:	Single seizure

I reviewed this 70-year-old man by telephone consultation today. On 23/10/2020 he had a transient loss of consciousness. He had gone out for a coffee with his wife in the morning. He remembers sitting on the chair in the café before loosing consciousness. The next thing that he remembers is waking up in the emergency department in hospital. He had bit the side of his tongue and his muscles ached for days afterwards.

His wife said that he went blank and unresponsive before letting out a cry and going stiff and then collapsing to the floor. His arms and legs shook for a few minutes. He was as if was asleep afterwards and it took several hours for him to be back to normal.

Mr Parry has never had any previous episodes like this and he has not had any subsequent episodes. He was born normally but had 2 febrile seizures at the ages of 3 and 5 and also was knocked unconscious whilst playing cricket when he was in his twenties.  He has never had meningitis or encephalitis. He takes ramipril for hypertension and has diet controlled diabetes. His mother had epilepsy but there is no other relevant family history.

He is a retired draughtsman, smokes a pipe and drinks around 10 pints of mild beer every week. He has a driving licence.

An ECG from A+E shows sinus rhythm with a slight right axis deviation. A CT head from 23/10/2020 was normal.

I spoke with Tanya who is Mr Rowlands carer today. As you know he had a cluster of convulsive seizures for the first time in February. He suddenly went unconscious during a meal, let out a scream and started shaking. His lips went blue and the care home staff phoned 999. He was admitted to hospital then and started on levetiracetam. He has got quite advanced dementia and needs help for all activites of daily living and has no verbal communication. 

Tanya has noticed that Mr Rowlands gets some “blank” episodes recently. During these he will stare and look blank for a couple of minutes and sometimes fall asleep afterwards.

Impression. Mr Rowlands has an epilepsy which is probably caused by his underlying dementia.

Comments. I think that the “blank” episodes are focal seizures with altered awareness and so it would be worth increasing the levetiracetam to 500mg bd. The care home staff or yourself can contact the epilepsy helpline should there be any issues with his epilepsy in the future.

Flat 2, 46 Tyler Street, Sunvillage, Swansea SA6 9IN

Mr Smith was reviewed in the Neurology first fit clinic today via telephone consultation. He was referred from General Practice, following recent episodes concerning for seizures.
He is a 17-year-old male with no significant past medical history, and he does not take any regular medications. He denies any illicit drug use.
Mr Smith is currently studying in college, lives with his parents and learning to drive.
For several months he has noticed he has been “clumsy”, particularly early in the morning where he has a tendency to drop items. This does not seem related to sleep or meals. The frequency of these appears to be increasing to almost daily.
In June this year he had a collapse episode whilst in college. This occurred early in the morning and was witnessed. He felt non-specifically unwell and collapsed from his chair, and was noted to have jerking movements of his arms and legs for 2 minutes. He recalls coming around with the paramedics around him but refused hospital admission. He may have been a little sleep-deprived but there were no other obvious triggers.
On questioning, in his younger years he was told he had poor concentration and was often day-dreaming. However, there is no history of any other convulsive seizures, and no events in childhood. He was born at full term, via normal delivery, and reached his developmental milestones at appropriate ages. There is no relevant family history.
As yet he has not undergone any investigations.
Overall, the history is consistent with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. I have explained the diagnosis, advised on safety measures and will send out some further information. I have also advised him that he is currently ineligible to drive.
Plan
1. Blood tests
2. ECG
3. EEG

Myoclonic jerks daily.
Occasional absences.

Current anti epileptic medication: 	lamotrigine 250 mg BD
Sodium valproate 700 mg BD

Investigations: MRI 2015 normal
EEG 2014 generalised spike and wave with polyspikes.
I reviewed this 23-year-old man by telephone for the first time. Previously his epilepsy has been looked after at balmoral Hospital. His epilepsy started at the age of 12. He remembers spilling things at breakfast time due to jerks in his arms. With hindsight these were myoclonic seizures. He had his first generalised tonic chronic seizure at the age of 14. He frequently gets myoclonic jerks before the generalised tonic chronic seizures. Although the generalised tonic clonic seizures were infrequent at first they are now happening frequently. He is having one to 2 generalised tonic clonic seizures every month.
Unfortunately Efan suffers with his mental-health. He gets a lot of anxiety which makes it difficult to sleep at the moment. In the past he has found clobazam useful when he gets clusters of seizures. Interestingly a paternal aunt probably had absence epilepsy. He currently lives with his partner.
Impression: mr Evans has juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
Comments: it may be that the lamotrigine is making the jerks worse and I would suggest slowly reducing it by 25 mg every month.
I would be very grateful if you would assess Mr Evans’s anxiety and consider treating it. There is no contraindication to using antidepressants in epilepsy and indeed it may improve his seizures. I will review him again in clinic in a few months time but if there is a problem with his epilepsy in the meantime he should contact the epilepsy helpline.

Miss Lewis was reviewed in the Neurology clinic today via telephone consultation. She was referred from General Practice, after being identified as taking sodium valproate as part of the Prevent programme.
She is a 27-year-old female who was diagnosed with Epilepsy at the age of 18 whilst living in London. She had two unprovoked generalised seizures, and was trialled on multiple anti-epileptic drugs including Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine, and Carbamazepine which were either ineffective or caused side-effects. Once commenced on sodium valproate 400mg twice daily, she has had no further seizures. She does not experience any significant side-effects and takes the medication reliably. Her MRI brain and EEG were normal at the time of diagnosis.
There is no other significant past medical history, and she does not take any other regular medications. There is no relevant family history.
We discussed the Prevent programme and the need to take reliable effective contraception whilst taking Sodium Valproate, due to the risk of side-effects to the developing baby should she become pregnant.

I reviewed the 36 year old salesman today in clinic. I had not met him before. He was born in Scotland and has only lived in Wales for the last two years. His previous epilepsy investigations and care has been in Scotland. His epilepsy started when he was 10 years old. He had a febrile seizure at the age of 3. He has got episodic migraine for which he take sumitryptan. There is no family history of epilepsy. He has been back driving for the last year
 
His seizures are quite stereotyped in that he gets a strange sensation in his left arm which rises towards his face. On the two occasions he has had bigger seizures they have started in the same way before he has lost consciousness.
 
He has forgotten to take his medication a few times recently and felt a lot clearer and more alert and so he asked about stopping his medication. We had a long discussion about the risks of further seizures and given the clear changes on his MRI scan he would be a relatively high risk of further seizures in the future which would affect his ability to drive. So we decided to try a slightly reduced dose of the lamotrigine. I would suggest reducing by 25 mg every fortnight until he is on a dose of 200mg twice a day. I explained that the DVLA do recommend refraining from driving whilst changes are being made to medication.

Re: 	Mr Francis Maudely DOB 7/03/1970

Many thanks for referring this 46 year old man to neurology. The diagnosis of epilepsy was made approximately 6 years ago. He was having seizures with a frequency of one to two per week at the onset. A typical episode will start with pains in the right arm followed by a fall and generalised shakes with loss of consciousness. There hasn't been a history of tongue bites. After the episode he is disoriented it for around 20 to 30 minutes. Unfortunately I was unable to obtain an eyewitness account. 

I understand that he has been on eplim and then changed over to lamotragine. A previous CT scan of the brain in 2002 was normal as was an EEG examination. 

During the time that he has been on lamotrigine he has continued to have seizures around once per week. 

His birth was normal as were his developmental milestones. There's no history of febrile seizures or brain infections. He did get a minor head injury in the past. His paternal uncle had epilepsy. Currently he has depression and previously he has consumed too much alcohol and though at the moment he is not drinking alcohol at all.

Examination is essentially normal. 

He does seem to have longstanding seizures , however the nature of these is not very clear. We do need to keep in mind the possibility of non epileptic attack disorder. 

I will request investigations including an ECG, EEG and MRI scan. I will ask the epilepsy specialist needs to go through a detailed history over the phone. Although he was driving in the past he is not at the moment and understand the DVLA laws on driving. I will review again in around six months time.

I spoke to this 18-year-old gentleman today, in the virtual first seizure clinic. He had his first seizure in June 2016 and the second one in December 2016. Both were witnessed by his girlfriend. There was no warning and no trigger.

She described how he let out a scream and lost consciousness. There was stiffening of his whole body followed by generalised jerking. There was stertorous breathing, a lateral tongue bite on one occasion but no cyanosis. It lasted for around 5 minutes and he was confused after. 

He is otherwise well and not on any other medication.  There is no history of intracranial infections, head injuries or febrile convulsions.  There is no clear history of myoclonic jerks.

I Reviewed the above patient who has epilepsy in the context of a cavernoma in the right temporal lobe. She has previously had fairly frequent partial seizures and so we added levetiracetam to her Lamictal. She is currently taking Lamictal 150mg BD and levetiracetam 1250 mg BD. Miss little feels that levetiracetam hasn't really helped her seizures and is probably made her mood feel worse. As you know she's previously had episodes of depression.

I reviewed this young man in the clinic today.   He has been seizure free since before Christmas.  He has no side effects on the Carbamazepine except for he doesn’t like the taste and I have therefore given them a prescription for chewtabs.  If he likes these and can tolerate them, I have asked them to get a repeat prescription from you for this.

We will review him as above.

Re: 	Mr Nathan Bloodlock	D.O.B: 10/10/2003 NHS 123 587 6542

Diagnosis: Focal epilepsy 

Medication: Nil

Follow: Teenage epilepsy clinic

I reviewed this young man in the clinic today.  He came with both his parents.  He is currently in Year 7.  He has had a second seizure at the beginning of December.  It occurred at approximately midnight.  He remembers his head turning to the left and his left side becoming stiff.  He was able to alert his family but can then remember nothing until he found the ambulance crew looking after him.  He had a bit of a headache and felt sick.  

His mother came up and found him shaking all over with his eyes open.  They think that this lasted 5 – 7 minutes.  He had bitten his lip.  Afterwards, he had a headache and felt sick but was back to normal the next day.  They both occurred when he was tired but otherwise there were no obvious precipitants.

The semiology of this seizure was not like that of Benign Rolandic Epilepsy and his EEG would not support this.  His MRI is normal.  

I have told them that he has a greater than 50% chance of having a further seizure, but this could be next week or in several years’ time.  We discussed whether he would benefit from treatment, but they were very wary of side effects.  I have given them some information about both Carbamazepine and Lamotrigine and the address of the Epilepsy Action website.  They will go and have a look at this and decide whether they would like him to be treated or not.
Yours sincerely





",IIB,"The patient has had two seizures since his initial seizure, indicating rare disabling seizures since the undefined 'surgery' or start of follow-up. This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - Rare disabling seizures since surgery. While he has had seizure-free intervals, they have not amounted to greater than half the follow-up period and it has not been at least 2 years, so an Engel III score would not apply. There is no indication of worthwhile seizure reduction or change, so Engel IV would not apply either.

I reviewed this 20-year old man in clinic today. He has been having seizure-like episodes now for around 1 year. They can happen up to several times per week. When they occur Mr Summers seems to ""zone out"" and he finds it diffiult to follow what's going on. He can hear people talking but it is difficult for him to responds. He has not had any jerking episodes which resemble myoclonus.
 
His father said that they can happen when standing or sitting and he tends to have a blank look although he is completely still.
 
He was born normally, did not have any febrile seizures or meningitis. There is no relevant family history. He does get typical migraine episodes once a month for which he takes sumitriptan.
 
His MRI was normal and his EEG was normal although it didn't capture any events. There was no photosensitivity.
 
I do not think that these are epileptic seizures and are more likely to be dissociative seizures. i explained the driving rules - Mr Summers should not drive while they are happening and should inform the DVLA. A video of the event will also be useful.

Re: 	Miss Lemwn Thomas 	D.O.B: 07/12/1998
24 Heol Betws, Morriston, Swansea, SA12 6KG  

Diagnosis:
•	New diagnosis of epilepsy with generalised tonic clonic seizures from sleep
•	Type 1 diabetes

Medication:
•	Insulin
•	Levetiracetam 250mgs once a day, increasing by 250mgs every 2 weeks to 500mgs bd

I reviewed this 18-year-old lady in the Virtual First Seizure Clinic along with her boyfriend. She has had a few episodes from sleep.  The first occurred in May 2017. Her boyfriend was woken by her shaking and groaning. Lemwn came round in hospital feeling disorientated.  Her BM was within normal range.  

The most recent episode occurred last week and was similar in nature. Head and eyes were tunred to the side, there was jerking, hyper-salivation and noisy breathing.  On this occasion, she bit her tongue and felt disorientated on coming round.  Her BM was checked immediately afterwards, which was 3.4.   

There are no obvious triggers for this.  There is no previous history of seizures, head injuries or intracranial infections.  

She has a background of type 1 diabetes and has occasional hypos, so is aware of the symptoms.  She has no other medical problems and is not on any other medication.  

She lives with her parents and is currently studying English in University. She is learning to drive, is a non-smoker and drinks occasional alcohol.  

Impression:

Lemwn has had episodes suggestive of unprovoked generalised tonic clonic seizures, occurring from sleep. It is possible that there is a focal, frontal lobe onset but she needs further investigations  There is no evidence to suggest that these were secondary to hypoglycaemia.  We discussed the following:

1.	In terms of further investigations, I will arrange an MRI brain and an EEG.
2.	I think she needs to go on antiepileptic medication and I will start Levetiracetam as shown above.  The main side effects are tiredness, light-headedness and occasionally a change in mood
3.	We discussed the driving regulations.  She will need to inform the DVLA and refrain from driving, until she has been seizure free for 12 months (although there are some caveats in patients, who only have seizures from sleep)
4.	We discussed some of the issues around safety, such as having showers rather than baths.  We also discussed SUDEP (Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy) and I explained the risks as significantly reduced by being on treatment for epilepsy.
5.	I will request a follow up appointment with the epilepsy specialist nurses in a couple of months.

I had a telephone consultation with miss Troy today. She has been diagnosed with non epileptic psychogenic seizures which is confirmed on EEG.In the past she has had a normal MRI . She also has significant anxiety. 

She has been seizure free for more than five years. She only drinks a small amount of alcohol and doesn't take any recreational drugs. 

She does continue to take sodium valproate 200 milligrammes twice a day. She feels that when the sodium valproate was reduced she started having episodes of shakiness without losing consciousness and it had to be restarted.

She still gets a few panic attacks but in general she is less angry. I understand that the community mental health team are in contact with her about this.

Diagnosis:
•	Focal epilepsy

Medication:
•	Brivaracetam 75 mgs bd

I spoke to James on the phone today.  I am pleased to say that he has been seizure free since starting antiepileptic medication.  

Unfortunately however, he has had problems with mood swings and irritability.  He switched Levetiracetam to Brivaracetam, with a little improvement. He has a good insight into potential causes of this, including the impact the diagnosis has had on his mental health and lifestyle, particularly inability to drive, and the general impact of COVID and lockdown.  

Plan:

We discussed the options of continuing Brivaracetam, or switching to an alternative medication, such as Lamotrigine.  While it is possible that this would be better in terms of irritability, there is no guarantee that it would control his seizures as well and for now he would prefer to continue unchanged.  He knows how to get hold of us on the above helpline number as needed.

Mr Harris had 4 seizures for the first time in February this year. They were witnessed by his wife and she gives a good description of tonic clonic seizure with limb stiffness, jerking and sturtuous breathing. He was started on the lamotrigine at the time and I am happy to report that there have been no furthere seizures.
 
He has previously had a MI and has hypercholestrolaemia. He smokes 25 cigarettes a day and takes simvastatin, clopidogrel as well as the lamotrigine.

His birth was normal and so were his milestones. He has not had any head injuries, brain infections or febrile seizures.

I reviewed Mr Herbert together with his partner in clinic today. He has not had any further seizures but does feel quite anxious in himself. He is also quite tearful at times. His partner thinks that he is more irritable than usual.

We went through his diagnosis of epilepsy and the fact that there is an old change in his brain in the left temporal lobe which is the probable cause of his epilepsy. This was present on his MRI scan in February 2019.

Levetiracetam can cause mood change and irritability and so we decided to change to lamotrigine. I would be grateful if you could introduce lamotrigine at 25mg od, increasing by 25mg every fortnight until a dose of 75mg bd is reached. At the same time please reduce the levetiracetam by 250mg every fortnight until it stops.

Mrs Jones was reviewed in the Neurology first fit clinic today via telephone consultation. She was referred from the A&E department in Morriston Hospital, following a recent episode of collapse.
She is a 74-year-old female with a background of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Her current medication includes clopidogrel 75mg OD, Ramipril 2.5mg OD, and metformin 500mg BD.
Mrs Jones lives alone and is normally very active. She continues to drive and is independent of activities of daily living. She is an ex-smoker and does not drink any alcohol.
We discussed the collapse episode which occurred 6 weeks prior to this review. Whilst sitting in a chair at home, Mrs Jones suddenly felt her heart racing and had some mild central chest pain. She next recalls waking up on the floor with her daughter kneeling next to her. Whilst on the floor she was witnessed to have mild jerking of her limbs for a few seconds. On regaining consciousness, she was orientated to time and place, with no further chest pain or palpitations.
Whilst in A&E she underwent an ECG which showed an old left bundle branch block and a CT head which did not identify any acute pathology. Routine blood tests were unremarkable and a first troponin was within normal limits with no repeat measured.
Mrs Jones cannot recall any other episodes of collapse before or since this event.
Overall, the history of chest pain and palpitations is more suggestive of a cardiac cause for this event with no significant seizure markers. There is evidence of pre-existing structural heart disease and further cardiac investigations would be recommended. Mrs Jones has been informed by the team in A&E that she cannot drive and must inform the DVLA.

In general, they have occurred without warning. There is generalised stiffening and shaking, stertorous breathing and cyanosis. He has bitten his tongue and is postictal for up to 48 hours afterwards.  One occurred on waking and one after a night out.  

There is a history of what sound like myoclonic jerks, sometimes in the morning affecting his limbs often after nights out.

I met Mrs Gwyn for the first time today in clinic. She developed epilepsy three years after her stroke. She is currently being treated with sodium valproate taking 500mg per day. Her seizures have been reasonably well controlled on this dose. The maximum period that she has been without seizures is 3 years.

Mrs Gwynn did have a cluster of seizures in February or March this year. There is no obvious trigger to these seizures. She denies any significant side effects with the epilim. She is now post menopausal. 

Mrs Gwyn has got a raised BMI and therefore sodium valproate may not be the best medication for her especially that she has diabetes. She's not keen to make any changes to her medication. However she would accept trying small dose of another medication for better control of her seizures. I'd be very grateful if you could start her only zonisamide 25 mg od to be increased by 25 mg every two weeks until she is on a maintenance dose of 50MG twice a day. Mrs gwynn does not drive.

Diagnosis	1. Symptomatic structural epilepsy secondary probably caused by early life meningitis
2. learning difficulties

Medication:	Brivaracetam  1000mg twice daily
		Lamotrigine 200mg bd

Seizure type and frequency: focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, last event 2015
Focal seizures with altered awareness, last event 2017

EEG 1/5/2005: bitemporal slowing

Other medication include warfarin, ramipril, bisprolol, gabapentin
		

I reviewed Mr Gold together with his support worker Ana Harding in clinic today. I was please to hear that the switch from levetiracetam to brivertiracetam has gone well and Mr Gold’s mood has improved. His seizures are also well controlled. 
I will leave him with an open appointment with the epilepsy service.
",IC,"The patient has been seizure-free since 2015 based on the note stating 'focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, last event 2015'. This meets the criteria for Engel class I. However, the patient did have focal seizures with altered awareness as recently as 2017. Having disabling seizures after surgery but being free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years meets the criteria for subclass IC. Therefore, the Engel score for this patient is IC."

Dear Dr

r.e. Ms Linda Ivy. DOB 02/01/1980

Diagnosis: Probable temporal lobe epilepsy
 
I reviewed this 38 year old woman by telephone consultation today. She has previously been reviewed by my colleagues. Her epilepsy started at the age of 3 years old and has continued ever since. The longest period of seizures freedom that she has had is 2 years. Currently she gets seizures about once per month which are complex partial seizures. She will have a funny feeling of a “fuzzy” head before losing awareness and wandering about in a confused manner. She has only had a few secondarily generalised seizures in her life the last one being about 10 years ago when she forgot her medication.
 
She is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg bd as well as carbamazepine 400mg bd. In the past she has tried, sodium valproate, topiramate and lamotrigine. An MRI in 2012 showed probable left hippocampal sclerosis and EEGs in the past have showed consistent left focal temporal slowing.
 
She was born normally at term but did get 2 febrile seizures at the age of 18 and 28 month. When she was 7 years old she fell of her bike and lost consciousness for 30mins. She was observed in hospital overnight but didn’t need any surgery. Her youngest sister has had two febrile seizures and a maternal aunt has epilepsy and takes carbamazepine for this.
 
She works as a teaching assistant and does not drive. She smokes around 10 cigaretts a day and drinks a bottle of wine at the weekend. She lives with her husband and two children who are aged 6 and 4.
 
Impression. She does have temporal lobe epilepsy which is probably caused by the hippocampal sclerosis.
 
Plan I would suggest changing the carbazmazepine to eslicarbazine 800mg od
I will update the MRI and then discuss at the epilepsy surgery MDT as there would be a possibility of surgery for her epilepsy

",IIC,"The patient has complex partial seizures about monthly causing impairment, with rare generalized seizures historically. This fits IIC criteria based on seizure frequency, disability level, and pattern over an extended duration."

Dear Dr

r.e. Helena Cariad	D.O.B:	07/01/1990
36, slow street, Trearaf, Swansea SA9 8IK

Helena got in touch with the epilepsy service via the epilepsy helpline as she has a seizure last week. Her last seizure before this was in 2006. She is 2 weeks post-partum after giving birth to her second son, Oliver. It was a difficult delivery with frequent episodes of vomiting. Oliver is waking frequently in the night at the moment for feeds and so Helena is feeling very tired.

Helena is taking lamotrigine 75mg twice a day and we discussed taking more of the medication. Helena was happy to continue taking the 75mg twice a day as she now thinks the medication is being absorbed better that the vomiting has stopped.

I have arranged more follow up in around six weeks although Helena knows that she can contact me in the meantime if there are any problems.

Your sincerely,
",IIB,"The patient had a seizure last week, which was her first seizure since 2006. This indicates that she has rare disabling seizures since her last seizure. There is no mention of surgery in the note. Therefore, based on the Engel criteria, the patient would be classified as IIB - rare disabling seizures since surgery."

Diagnosis: 	Epilepsy, Unclassified

Seizure type and frequency: Bilateral convulsive seizures, last event two weeks ago

Current anti-epileptic medication:	Lamotrigine 75mg twice a day (to increase as detailed below)

Other medication includes:	Gabapentin and Mirtazapine.

Investigations:	MRI 2008, non-specific white matter changes only
		Previous EEG results not available

I met this 30-year-old woman together with her sister in clinic today. She has previously met my collegue Dr Love.

As you know she had her first seizure at the age of 22. She rembers when this happened, she had no warning and the first thing she remembers is waking up in the back of the ambulance. Her sister said that she went blank, stared for a while and then lost consciousness. She let out a scream and fell to the floor stiff and convulsing. She bit her tongue.

She went two years without another event which happened after she had gone to her sisters wedding. She felt hungover and nauseated the next day and had a similar event which was a convulsive epileptic seizures. There is no obvious trigger to her seizures, she does not have photosensitivity and has never had absences or myoclonus.

She has had infrequent seizures every since, around 1 or two per year.

She does have some depression and takes the mirtazapine to good effect for this. She is otherwise well and works in her father’s butchers shop. She has two children aged 3 and 5 who are well, although the youngest Ieuan had one febrile seizures. She herself had 2 febrile seizures at the age of 3 and 4. She did have a head injury when she was knoced off her bike at the age of 8 and was unconscious for about 10 minuts. Her paternal uncle has epilepsy for which he takes epilim.

Her neurological examination was normal apart from a longstanding slight left ptosis which has not changed. Her previous investigations are as above.

We went over the DVLA driving regulations for epilepsy. I would suggest increasing the lamotirigne by 25mg every fornight until she is taking 125mg twice a day. If Ms Cariad needs anti-depressant treatment then that would be no contraindication with her epilepsy.

I will review her EEG records for completeness and let you know the results.
",IIB,The patient has rare (1-2 per year) disabling convulsive bilateral seizures despite treatment with anti-epileptic medication. This meets criteria for Engel score IIB: Rare disabling seizures since surgery.

r.e. Mr William Williams, 99, Heol y Cwrw, Llandoris. SA99 7TF
 
diagnosis: symptomatic focal epilepsy as a result of premature delivery, right sided weakness.
 
management: change from carbamazepine to eslicarbazepine
 
follow up: 19-SEP-18
 
I reviewed Mr Williams in Dr Price's clinic today; he came with his brother who was very helpful. He gets infrequent seizures, maybe twice a year. I contacted the GP practice today to check that Mr Williams is taking 400mg of carbamazapine twice a day. Mr Williams would like to change to a once daily preperation and so I would be grateful if you could switch to eslicarbazepine 800mg once a day.
 
It would be useful if you could please check vitamin d levels in a few weeks given that carbamazepine can affect bone health.

",IB,"The patient is reported to have 'infrequent seizures, maybe twice a year'. This indicates that the patient continues to have some seizures, but they are described as infrequent and there is no mention of them being disabling. An Engel score of IB corresponds to 'Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery'. Although it is not specified whether these seizures are simple partial, the lack of mention of disabling seizures matches the IB criteria. The seizures are also described as infrequent, rather than rare, which fits better with IB than IIA or IIB. Therefore, I have assigned a score of IB based on the available information."

Dear Dr

r.e. Mr Gary Gold.  D.O.B.: 12/12/1950
The Care Home, Moon Drive, Suntoen. CA33 2JR

Diagnosis	1. Symptomatic structural epilepsy secondary probably caused by early life meningitis
2. learning difficulties

Medication:	Levetiracetam 1000mg bd
		Lamotrigine 200mg bd

Other medication include warfarin, ramipril, bisprolol, gabapentin
		

I reviewed Mr Gold together with his brother, who is his main carer, in clinic today. Things are reasonable from an epilepsy point of view. Mr Gold does get occasional periods of aggression which is sometimes difficult to manage. He gets focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, the last one was 2 years ago. He also gets focal seizures with altered awareness where he will smack his lips, stare into the distance and might fiddle with his clothes. These occur every month and are sometimes associated with infections.

Mr Gold had meningitis at the age of 7 months and it is thought that his epilepsy has been caused by this. He had an MRI on 4/5/2016, this showed generalised brain atrophy which white matter ischaemic change. An EEG in 2005 showed bitemporal slowing.

I would suggest changing the levetiracetam to brivaracetam given the ongoing problems with mood and aggression. I recommend a straight switch to brivaracetam 100mg bd. I will ask the epilepsy nurses to review in a few months.

",IIB,Mr. Gold continues to have focal seizures with altered awareness that occur about monthly. These are described as sometimes being disabling. He also has a history of convulsive seizures but has not had one in over 2 years. The IIB category best captures his situation of having rare disabling focal aware seizures since the undefined 'surgery'.

Dear Dr

RE	Frey Little DOB:	12-APR-1972

Date seen: 	02-APR-2013
Diagnosis:	Simple partial seizures with occasional secondary generalisation
MRI 2009:	Temporal lobe cavernoma
Past medical history:	Depression
Current medication	Lamotrigine 150mg bd
			Recommend add Topiramate
Follow up	4 months.

I reviewed this 41 year old right handed woman in clinic today. She has previously been under the care of my colleague. Her seizures started at the age of 15 and consist of an unusual, difficult to describe sensation and taste. This can last up to a minute. Sometimes this is followed by a collapse after which she feels very tired. The smaller versions of the attacks can happen several times per week. The best period of seizure freedom that she has had is probably around three years of seizure freedom which she had in her early 30s. 

At present she is taking lamotrigine 150 milligrammes twice a day. In the past she has tried levetiracetam which didn't really affect her seizures but seemed to make her mood worse. She has had depression in the past. She drinks around 2 bottles of wine per week but does not smoke. She stays at home to look after her three children. His father has a history of epilepsy. 

Her examination today was normal and her blood pressure was 122 slash 72. 

The aim would be to get better seizure control. I would be grateful if you could prescribe topiramate starting at 25 milligrammes daily for two weeks followed by 25 milligrammes twice a day. This should further be increased by 25 milligrammes every fortnight until a total dose of 200MG twice a day is reached. 

We will request an up to date EEG and I will review her again in clinic in around six months time. 

",IIC,"The patient has a history of simple partial seizures with occasional secondary generalization starting at age 15. She has periods of seizure freedom, with the best period being about 3 years in her early 30s. Currently on lamotrigine 150mg twice daily, she continues to have seizures several times per week, though it is unclear if these are all disabling. She has not had disabling seizures for at least 2 years based on the history provided. Therefore, the best Engel score appears to be IIC - More than rare disabling seizures after surgery, but rare seizures for at least 2 years."

Dear Dr,

Re: Ursella Underwood dob 3/3/1971

I reviewed this pleasant 45 year-old  lady in my first seizure clinic today. She was accompanied to the clinic by her sister. For the last six month she has been having possible seizures. She says she gets a feeling of detachment which is followed by blacking out. Her sister reported that there is some jerking of her arms and legs and some frothing of the mouth. When she comes around, she feels tired and confused. She says it takes up to 2 hours to fully get back to normal. Current frequency of the seizures is once or twice a month, but last month there was a cluster of 3 in a single day and she was taken to A&E. There is also a history of staring episodes which last up to 2 minutes. They occur 3 to 5 times a week. 

Ms Underwood lives with her partner who is often away. Her sister has been staying with them since February. There is no family history of note. She is not aware of having suffered febrile seizures in her childhood or any serious infections. There is no history of head injuries. Ms Underwood is currently not working but she volunteers in a charity shop. She stopped driving. There was some history of alcohol abuse, but she said she now only drinks occasionally, and not at all since starting treatment. She is a non-smoker.

Her examination today was normal, with no neurological deficit.

She is still awaiting her EEG examination. I am also requesting an MRI brain .

My impression is that we are dealing with generalised tonic clonic seizures probably with a focal onset. Her other episode could possibly be complex partial seizures. 

She was commenced on Sodium Valproate following her seizure cluster and is now on 400mg bd. She has not experienced any side effects. She has not yet reached the maintenance dose but given her history and her weight concerns this may not be the best choice of treatment. I suggest we start her on Levetiracetam 250mg od increasing by 250mg increments weekly until she reaches 500mg bd. Once her seizures are controlled Sodium Valproate should be reduced to nil gradually. 

She has been advices on safety at home and lifestyle issues. She knows she can contact our epilepsy helpline with any concerns and to seek medical help in the event of further seizures. 
I will see her again in my clinic in 3 months. 

Yours sincerely
",IIB,"The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since the recent onset of her condition about 6 months ago. She has generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring once or twice a month, with a recent cluster of 3 seizures in one day requiring an ER visit. She also has staring spells occurring 3-5 times per week. These seizures are occurring despite antiepileptic drug treatment with sodium valproate. However, the frequency of disabling seizures appears to meet criteria for Class II - Rare Disabling Seizures. Specifically, subclass IIB fits with rare disabling seizures since the onset of the epilepsy."

Re: 	Mrs Kirstie Kritching D.O.B. 19/04/1952

Diagnosis:	Symptomatic structural temporal lobe epilepsy
		Early life meningitis
		Cardiovascular disease (MI 2011)
		Atrial fibrillation
		COPD

Anti-seizure medication:	Lamotrigine 200mg twice a day
			Zonisamide 100mg twice a day

Other medications includes:	Apixiban, clopidogrel, simvastatin, furosemide

Seizure type and frequency:	Focal seizures with altered awareness, around 2 per month
				Focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, last event 2013

Previous investigations:		EEG with left sided slowing
				MRI 2010, generalised brain atrophy with left sided gliosis

I reviewed Mrs Kritching together with her husband who is her carer. Things are quite stable from an epilepsy point of view and probably been the best they have for a while.

As you know Mrs Kritching had meningitis at the age of 6 months which was quite severe and needed a prolonged spell in intensive care. This is the probable cause for her epilepsy. She also had around 5 febrile seizures although she’s never had a significant head injury. Her mother had epilepsy in later life as did a maternal uncle.

She has never worked and does enjoy the ocassional cigar but doesn’t drink alcohol. I was pleased to hear that her mood is good and generally she was quite cheerful. We talked about different treatment options but given that Mrs Kritching has tried many other medications in the past (including phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate and phenobarba) without much success she was happy to leave things as they are today. I will continue to review in clinic. 

Yours


",IIA,"The patient is described as having focal seizures with altered awareness around 2 times per month. She also has a history of focal to bilateral convulsive seizures, with the last one occurring in 2013. This fits the IIA criteria of 'Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now'. Even though she has monthly seizures, these appear to be controlled and rare compared to her previous uncontrolled epilepsy. There is no mention of a recent prolonged seizure-free period over 2 years, so a score indicating 'worthwhile improvement' does not seem applicable. The overall impression is of good seizure control with rare breakthrough focal seizures, meeting IIA criteria."
