Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "1B",
  "reasoning": "The patient has primary generalized epilepsy and is on two anti-epileptic drugs (Epilim and carbamazepine). He had been seizure-free for about a year until he forgot to take his carbamazepine dose and had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This appears to be a non-disabling simple partial seizure triggered by missing medication. Aside from this one seizure, he has been seizure-free on medications. This fits the criteria for Engel class IB - non-disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery (or in this case, after medication adjustment)."  
}
```

The patient has had good seizure control on medications, with only one breakthrough seizure when he missed doses. This indicates he likely falls into Engel class IB based on the information provided. There is no evidence of multiple possible scores here. I provided detailed reasoning behind assigning the 1B Engel class. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
