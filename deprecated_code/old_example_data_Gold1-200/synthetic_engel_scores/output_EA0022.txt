Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IB - Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery.

My reasoning is:

1. The note states that the focal epileptic seizures seem to be "well controlled" on lamotrigine, suggesting they are not disabling. 

2. The patient continues to have "dizzy spells" lasting a few minutes where hearing is altered. Video EEG showed no epileptiform discharges during these events, suggesting they are non-epileptic dissociative seizures.

3. There is no mention of generalized tonic-clonic or other convulsive seizures.

4. The dissociative seizures would not factor into the Engel score since they are non-epileptic in nature.

Therefore, I believe Engel IB - Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery best captures this patient's level of seizure control from their epilepsy.

Here is the output in JSON format:

  "score": "IB",
