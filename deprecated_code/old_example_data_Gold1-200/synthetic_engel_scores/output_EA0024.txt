Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there is not enough evidence to definitively assign an Engel score. The note states that the patient has had around 10 unwitnessed episodes of loss of consciousness over the past 9 months, associated with reducing his alcohol intake. He has not had any seizures for the past 2 weeks. There is no mention of the patient having epilepsy or undergoing epilepsy surgery.

Without more details on the patient's seizure frequency, seizure types, response to medications, or surgery outcomes, it is difficult to accurately categorize the patient according to the Engel scale criteria. 

However, since some level of assessment is required, here is one possibility:

```json
{
  "score": "IVB",
  "reasoning": "The patient could potentially be assigned a score of IVB - No appreciable change. He has had around 10 episodes of unwitnessed loss of consciousness over 9 months. There are no details provided on seizure frequency before this 9 month period to determine if there has been an appreciable change. Additionally, there is no mention of the patient having a diagnosis of epilepsy, being on anti-seizure medications, or undergoing epilepsy surgery to determine outcome. Based on the limited information provided, a score of IVB indicating no appreciable change seems most reasonable."
}
```

Without more clinical details on this patient's condition and treatment, it is difficult to accurately categorize them on the Engel scale. Please provide additional history if a more definitive score is needed.
