Based on the information provided, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is having about 15 seizures over 4 months, which is characterized as 'rare disabling seizures' since surgery according to the Engel scale criteria. Specifically, category IIB indicates 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. While it is not clearly stated if the patient has had surgery, the instructions specify to ignore this aspect and assign a score based on the seizure frequency. With around 1 seizure per week on average, this fits the 'rare' seizures criteria better than category IIIA of 'worthwhile seizure reduction'. Therefore, I have assigned an Engel score of IIB."
}
```

There is only one clear score based on the information provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
