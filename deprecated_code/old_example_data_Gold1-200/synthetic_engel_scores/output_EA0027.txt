Based on the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score and reasoning:

```json
{
  "score": "IVC",
  "reasoning": "The patient is having occasional jerks with flashing lights, indicating she is still having some seizures, though the details and frequency are unclear. She does not appear to have achieved worthwhile improvement or prolonged seizure freedom. As she still seems to be experiencing disabling seizures, though less severe than her initial event, this would be classified as Class IV - No worthwhile improvement, with subclass IVC - Seizures worse."
}
```

The note does not provide enough details to determine if there could be multiple valid scores. There is no clear evidence the patient has achieved the requirements for Class I, II, or III. Given the limited information provided, I have assessed the patient as Class IVC as this seems most accurate based on the details noted. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to add.
