Based on the information provided, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IC.

Here is my analysis:

```json
{
  "score": "IC",
  "reasoning": "The patient had been seizure-free for 3 years until a recent generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This meets the IC criteria of 'Some disabling seizures after surgery, but free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years'. While it is not explicitly stated that the patient had surgery, the instructions specify to ignore that aspect and assign a score based solely on the seizure details provided."
}
```

There is only one clear score based on the seizure details given, so I have not included variations. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
