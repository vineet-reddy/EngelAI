Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IA",
  "reasoning": "The patient has been completely seizure-free since at least 7 months prior to this follow up appointment on 01/09/2012. This meets criteria IA for 'Completely seizure-free since surgery'. Even though it is not explicitly stated whether the patient has had surgery, the criteria specifies to ignore this detail for the purposes of this assignment. Therefore, the Engel score that best fits is IA."
}
```

There is no evidence of any seizures or anti-epileptic drug withdrawal in the provided clinical note. The patient is on two anti-epileptic medications, but has not had any seizures for at least 7 months, indicating complete seizure freedom. Thus, IA appears to be the only Engel score that matches this scenario based on the details provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
