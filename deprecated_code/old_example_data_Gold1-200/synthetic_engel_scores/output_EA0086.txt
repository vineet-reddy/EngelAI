Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is described as having 'infrequent focal seizures' and the note states 'He is very well and has had no further seizures.' This indicates he has experienced some non-disabling simple partial seizures since an unspecified prior date, but has been seizure-free recently. This fits the criteria for an Engel score of IB: 'Non disabling simple partial seizures only since surgery'." 
}
```

The note does not provide enough information to determine if any other Engel scores could apply. Only the IB score can be definitively assigned based on the details provided.
