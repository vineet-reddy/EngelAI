Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient has had rare disabling seizures since his last reported seizure in April 2019. He is still experiencing some seizures, though infrequently. This meets the criteria for Engel IIB - 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. While he has anxiety and some mood changes, these do not seem to be disabling at this time. There is no evidence of a prolonged seizure-free period over 2 years or worthwhile seizure reduction at this point. Therefore, IIB appears to be the most applicable Engel score."
}
```

There does not appear to be evidence to support multiple possible Engel scores based on the details provided. The score of IIB fits the available information. Please let me know if any clarification or additional details would be helpful!
