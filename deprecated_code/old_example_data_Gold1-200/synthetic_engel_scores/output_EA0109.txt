Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIA",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing focal seizures consisting of altered perception, déjà vu, and some somatic symptoms. These seizures were previously rare but have increased in frequency over the past year to 2-3 times per week. This pattern fits the IIA criteria of 'Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now.' While not explicitly stated, it is implied that these focal seizures are likely impairing functioning to some degree if requiring medication, meeting the 'disabling' qualification. An argument could potentially be made for a Class I score since seizure frequency and nature is not fully clear over the entire post-operative or follow-up period, but Class IIA is the best fit based on the details provided."
}
```

There is only one score provided, as no other Engel scores seem to fully match the limited details available in this brief clinical note. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
