Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient had two witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures, one in June 2016 and one in December 2016. He has not had any seizures since the second one in December 2016. This fits the criteria for Engel IIB - 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. Even though the patient has not had surgery, the instructions state to ignore whether the patient is post-surgery or not. With two disabling seizures spaced several months apart, the patient has had rare disabling seizures over the follow-up period. There is no evidence of any other type of seizures. Therefore, based on the information provided, Engel IIB appears to be the most appropriate score."
}
```

I do not see evidence to support multiple possible scores for this patient based on the information provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
