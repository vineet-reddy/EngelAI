Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign this patient an Engel score of IC.

My reasoning is as follows:

- The patient has a long history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, diagnosed around 16 years ago. 
- On her current medication regimen of Epilim, she has infrequent seizures, around 1 seizure every 2-3 years. 
- Her longest seizure-free period has been 4 years.
- This fits the criteria for Engel class IC: "Some disabling seizures after surgery, but free of disabling seizures for at least 2 years." Even though the patient has not had surgery, she has disabling seizures but goes for periods of over 2 years without disabling seizures.

Therefore, I believe Engel score IC is most appropriate here. There is no evidence to support another Engel score based on the details provided.

Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IC",
  "reasoning": "The patient has disabling generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but has seizure-free periods of over 2 years on her current medication regimen. This fits the criteria for Engel class IC." 
}
```

Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
