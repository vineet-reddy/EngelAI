Based on the information provided in the clinical note, here is my assessment of the patient's Engel score:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient is experiencing rare disabling seizures since the onset of his epilepsy 6 years ago, at a frequency of 1-2 per month. This fits the criteria for an Engel score of IIB: 'Rare disabling seizures since surgery'. Though it is not clearly stated if he has had surgery, the instructions specify to ignore that aspect and assign a score based solely on seizure frequency and impact. With 1-2 disabling seizures per month ongoing for the past 6 years, class I ('Free of disabling seizures') would not apply. Class IIA also would not apply since he has not had a period of being initially seizure-free. The seizures are disabling based on the description that he is unable to speak properly during them. Therefore, IIB appears to be the best fit score."
}
```

In this case, I believe IIB is the only score that fits based on the information provided. There is no evidence to support assigning multiple scores. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
