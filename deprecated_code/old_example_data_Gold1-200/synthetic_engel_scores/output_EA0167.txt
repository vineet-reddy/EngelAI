Based on the information provided in the clinical note, I would assign the patient an Engel score of IIA (Rare disabling seizures).

Here is my reasoning:

1. The patient has symptomatic temporal lobe epilepsy caused by previous herpes encephalitis. He takes anti-epileptic medications but continues to have seizures.

2. Over the past year, the patient has had around 5 focal seizures with altered awareness. These seizures involve abnormal sensations, difficulty speaking, and picking behaviors. 

3. The seizures are described as "relatively stable" and a "good" amount for this patient. This suggests the seizures, while disabling when they occur, are not frequent enough to be considered worsening or uncontrolled.

4. There is no information suggesting the patient has had prolonged seizure-free periods over the follow-up period. 

5. While a worthwhile seizure reduction from prior levels cannot be determined from the information provided, the seizures are also not described as appreciably worse.

In summary, the description of around 5 disabling focal seizures over a one year period fits the Engel IIA designation of "rare disabling seizures." There is no information to clearly support an alternative Engel score.

My formal response in JSON format:

```json
{
  "score": "IIA",
  "reasoning": "The patient has around 5 disabling focal seizures per year which fits the Engel IIA criteria of rare disabling seizures. There is no evidence of prolonged seizure freedom or worthwhile improvement, and the seizures are described as relatively stable rather than appreciably worse."
}
