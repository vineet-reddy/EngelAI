Based on the information provided in the clinical note, there are insufficient details to definitively assign an Engel score. The note indicates that the patient has been experiencing focal seizures with déjà vu, nausea, and an odd taste for the past 10 months, occurring 4-5 times per month. He has not yet undergone surgery. Without further details on the patient's seizure frequency and severity before and after surgery, it is not possible to accurately categorize his outcome using the Engel scale. 

However, to provide a score as requested, here is one possibility:

```json
{
  "score": "IIB",
  "reasoning": "The patient could potentially be assigned a score of IIB ('Rare disabling seizures since surgery') since he is experiencing focal seizures 4-5 times per month. However, without confirming he has undergone surgery and details on seizure frequency before/after surgery, this score cannot be accurately applied based on the information provided."
}
```

Since there are no definitive details provided to assign an Engel score, I have provided the above tentative score of IIB with the reasoning that there is insufficient information. Please let me know if any additional details from the clinical note or patient history can be provided to allow for an accurate Engel classification.
