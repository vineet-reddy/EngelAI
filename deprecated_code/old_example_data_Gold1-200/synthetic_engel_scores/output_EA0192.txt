Based on the information provided, here is the assessment:

```json
{
  "score": "IIA",
  "reasoning": "The patient is classified as Engel IIA ('Rare disabling seizures') based on the following:

- The patient has had only 1 seizure in the last 3 months since increasing his carbamazepine dose. This indicates he was initially free of disabling seizures after increasing medication, but has had a rare seizure since then.

- He has focal slowing on EEG indicative of seizure tendency, and a prior normal MRI.

- While the note states his memory and thinking have improved, there is no clear indication he is free of disabling seizures at this time. 

The criteria of IIA - 'Initially free of disabling seizures but has rare seizures now' - most closely matches this patient's status."
}
```

In this case there is only one Engel score that matches the information provided in the clinical note. If there were multiple possible classifications for this patient, I would list out the additional options with reasoning.
