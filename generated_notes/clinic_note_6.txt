Epilepsy Surgery Clinic Note
Date: November 17, 2024
Patient: Ms. Emily Richards
Age: 32 years
Hospital Number: 87654321
Referring Physician: Dr. Robert Johnson, Neurology

Reason for Review:
Post-operative follow-up after right anterior temporal lobectomy for drug-resistant epilepsy.

Diagnosis:
- Pre-surgical: Drug-resistant focal epilepsy with confirmed right temporal lobe seizure onset.
- Post-surgical: Focal epilepsy, post-resection, with significant reduction in seizure frequency.

History:
Current Antiepileptic Medication:
Lamotrigine 300 mg daily, Levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily, both well-tolerated.

Previous Antiepileptic Medications:
- Carbamazepine: Discontinued in 2018 due to adverse effects (dizziness, nausea).
- Valproic acid: Discontinued in 2020 due to weight gain and suboptimal seizure control.

Pre-Surgical Seizure History:
- Auras: Experienced an intense déjà vu sensation, lasting 30-60 seconds, preceding many of her seizures.
- Seizure Frequency Pre-Surgery: Approximately 120 days per year with seizures, often occurring in clusters.
- Seizure Types: Complex partial seizures with impaired awareness, occasional secondary generalization.
- Childhood History: No significant medical history until seizure onset at age 14.
- Family History: No known family history of epilepsy or neurological disorders.

Surgical History:
- Surgery Date: May 20, 2024.
- Procedure: Right anterior temporal lobectomy.
- Intraoperative Findings: Resected area included the right hippocampus and anterior temporal cortex, with pathology confirming hippocampal sclerosis.
- Post-operative Course: Uncomplicated recovery, with no neurological deficits or infections.

Post-Surgical Seizure Status:
- Seizure Frequency Post-Surgery: Approximately 20 days per year with seizures, a significant improvement.
- Current Seizure Freedom: Seizure-free for the past 3 months.
- Functional Outcomes: Resumed part-time work as a graphic designer in September 2024.

Investigations:
Pre-surgical Workup:
- MRI (2023): Demonstrated right mesial temporal sclerosis with hippocampal atrophy, no other structural abnormalities.
- Video EEG Monitoring (2023): Recorded multiple clinical seizures, all with onset in the right temporal lobe. No secondary generalization observed.
- Neuropsychological Assessment: Mild impairment in visuospatial abilities consistent with right temporal dysfunction.
- PET Scan (2023): Hypometabolism localized to the right temporal lobe, supporting focal epilepsy diagnosis.

Post-surgical Investigations:
- MRI (2024): Post-resection changes in the right anterior temporal lobe without evidence of residual or new pathology.
- EEG (2024): Mild background slowing over the right temporal region, without epileptiform discharges.

Clinical Assessment:
Ms. Richards was seen in the epilepsy clinic today for her routine post-surgical follow-up. She reports a significant reduction in seizure frequency since her surgery, with only a few brief episodes of impaired awareness over the past 6 months. She has been seizure-free for the past 3 months. She denies any medication side effects and feels her overall quality of life has improved.

Neurological examination was unremarkable, with no focal deficits. Cognitive testing in clinic revealed mild impairments in visuospatial abilities consistent with her pre-surgical assessment. Physical examination, including gait and coordination, was normal.

Discussion and Plan:
I commended Ms. Richards on her positive post-surgical outcome and discussed the importance of maintaining her current treatment regimen. We reviewed the following key points:
1. Continuation of lamotrigine and levetiracetam to maintain seizure control.
2. Lifestyle modifications, including adequate sleep, regular meals, stress management, and avoiding known triggers such as excessive alcohol.
3. The ongoing, albeit reduced, risk of seizure recurrence even after successful surgery.
4. The rare but serious risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is lower given her improved seizure control.

We discussed her prognosis, including the potential for further seizure reduction or complete freedom with time. I emphasized the need for close monitoring before considering any medication adjustments.

Follow-up Plan:
- Routine follow-up in 6 months, or sooner if symptoms recur or if she has questions.
- Referral to neuropsychology for repeat cognitive testing in 2025 to assess long-term memory and visuospatial outcomes post-surgery.

Ms. Richards expressed her satisfaction with her care and stated she feels optimistic about her quality of life moving forward. She understands she can contact the clinic if needed.
