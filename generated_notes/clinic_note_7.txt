Epilepsy Surgery Clinic Note
Date: November 17, 2024
Patient: Ms. Emily Richards
Age: 32 years
Hospital Number: 87654321
Referring Physician: Dr. Robert Johnson, Neurology

Reason for Review:
Post-operative follow-up after right anterior temporal lobectomy for drug-resistant epilepsy.

Diagnosis:
- Pre-surgical: Drug-resistant focal epilepsy with confirmed right temporal lobe seizure onset.
- Post-surgical: Focal epilepsy, post-resection, seizure-free since March 2024 surgery.

History:
Current Antiepileptic Medication:
Lamotrigine 200 mg twice daily, well-tolerated without side effects.

Previous Antiepileptic Medications:
- Levetiracetam: Discontinued in 2019 due to irritability and inadequate seizure control.
- Valproic acid: Discontinued in 2021 due to weight gain and tremor.

Pre-Surgical Seizure History:
- First Seizures (2017): Experienced several focal impaired awareness seizures characterized by staring, lip-smacking, and unresponsiveness lasting 1-2 minutes. Aura consisted of an indescribable rising epigastric sensation preceding the seizures.
- Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (2018â€“2023): Experienced 4-5 generalized tonic-clonic seizures per year, often following the focal onset seizures. Postictal confusion and fatigue lasting several hours.
- Childhood History: No history of febrile seizures or other neurological conditions.
- Family History: No known family history of epilepsy or seizure disorders.

Surgical History:
- Surgery Date: March 18, 2024.
- Procedure: Right anterior temporal lobectomy.
- Intraoperative Findings: Resected area included the right hippocampus and anterior temporal cortex, with pathology confirming focal cortical dysplasia.
- Post-operative Course: Uncomplicated recovery, with no neurological deficits or infections.

Post-Surgical Seizure Status:
- Seizure-Free Period: 8 months since surgery.
- Functional Outcomes: Resumed part-time work as a graphic designer in July 2024. Driving privileges pending further seizure freedom.

Investigations:
Pre-surgical Workup:
- MRI (2023): Demonstrated subtle right temporal cortical dysplasia, no other structural abnormalities.
- Video EEG Monitoring (2023): Recorded three clinical seizures, all with onset in the right temporal lobe. Two seizures progressed to bilateral tonic-clonic activity.
- Neuropsychological Assessment: Mild impairment in visual-spatial memory consistent with right temporal dysfunction.
- PET Scan (2023): Hypometabolism localized to the right temporal lobe, supporting focal epilepsy diagnosis.

Post-surgical Investigations:
- MRI (2024): Post-resection changes in the right anterior temporal lobe without evidence of residual or new pathology.
- EEG (2024): Normal background activity without epileptiform discharges.

Clinical Assessment:
Ms. Richards was seen in the epilepsy clinic today for her routine post-surgical follow-up. She reports no seizures, auras, or other episodes suggestive of epilepsy since her surgery. She has experienced no medication side effects and feels well overall. Her sleep quality and mood are good, and she denies symptoms of anxiety or depression.

Neurological examination was unremarkable, with no focal deficits. Cognitive testing in clinic revealed no changes in memory or attention since the pre-surgical neuropsychological assessment. Physical examination, including gait and coordination, was normal.

Discussion and Plan:
I congratulated Ms. Richards on her excellent post-surgical outcome and discussed the importance of maintaining her current treatment regimen. She was counseled on the ongoing, albeit reduced, risk of seizure recurrence even after successful surgery. The following key points were emphasized:
1. Long-term continuation of lamotrigine to minimize the risk of recurrence.
2. Lifestyle modifications, including adequate sleep, regular meals, stress management, and avoiding known triggers such as excessive alcohol.
3. The rare but serious risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is significantly lower given her seizure freedom.

We discussed her prognosis, including the likelihood of sustained seizure freedom and potential medication tapering in the distant future if seizure freedom persists. I emphasized the need for close monitoring before any changes are made to her treatment.

Follow-up Plan:
- Routine follow-up in 6 months, or sooner if symptoms recur or if she has questions.
- Referral to neuropsychology for repeat cognitive testing in 2025 to assess long-term memory outcomes post-surgery.
- Consideration of resuming driving privileges after 12 months of sustained seizure freedom, pending further evaluation.

Ms. Richards expressed her satisfaction with her care and stated she feels optimistic about her quality of life moving forward. She understands she can contact the clinic if needed.
