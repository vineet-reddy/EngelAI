While not explicitly stated, it is implied that these focal seizures are likely impairing functioning to some degree if requiring medication, meeting the 'disabling' qualification. An argument could potentially be made for a Class I score since seizure frequency and nature is not fully clear over the entire post-operative or follow-up period, but Class IIA is the best fit based on the details provided.\n",
