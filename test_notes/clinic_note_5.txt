Epilepsy Surgery Clinic Note
Date: November 17, 2024
Patient: Ms. Emily Watson
Age: 32 years
Hospital Number: 87654321
Referring Physician: Dr. Robert Johnson, Neurology

Reason for Review:
Post-operative follow-up after right anterior temporal lobectomy for drug-resistant epilepsy.

Diagnosis:
- Pre-surgical: Drug-resistant focal epilepsy with confirmed right temporal lobe seizure onset.
- Post-surgical: Focal epilepsy, post-resection, seizure-free since March 2024 surgery.

History:
Current Antiepileptic Medication:
Lacosamide 200 mg twice daily, well-tolerated without side effects.

Previous Antiepileptic Medications:
- Valproic acid: Discontinued in 2018 due to weight gain and tremor.
- Levetiracetam: Discontinued in 2020 due to irritability and inadequate seizure control.

Pre-Surgical Seizure History:
- First Seizures (2016): Experienced recurrent focal aware seizures (auras) characterized by an intense déjà vu sensation and nausea, followed by impaired awareness and automatisms (lip-smacking, repetitive hand movements). Seizures lasted 1-2 minutes with postictal confusion for 10-15 minutes.
- Auras: Experienced daily déjà vu auras lasting 30-60 seconds without progressing to seizures.
- Seizure Frequency: Approximately 120 days per year with seizures despite medication trials.
- Childhood History: No history of febrile seizures or other neurological conditions.
- Family History: No family history of epilepsy or seizure disorders.

Surgical History:
- Surgery Date: March 15, 2024.
- Procedure: Right anterior temporal lobectomy.
- Intraoperative Findings: Resected area included the right hippocampus and anterior temporal cortex, with pathology confirming hippocampal sclerosis.
- Post-operative Course: Uncomplicated recovery, with no neurological deficits or infections.

Post-Surgical Seizure Status:
- Seizure-Free Period: 8 months since surgery.
- Functional Outcomes: Resumed part-time work as a graphic designer in July 2024. Driving reinstatement pending in January 2025 after meeting the seizure-free guidelines.

Investigations:
Pre-surgical Workup:
- MRI (2023): Demonstrated right mesial temporal sclerosis with hippocampal atrophy, no other structural abnormalities.
- Video EEG Monitoring (2023): Recorded three clinical seizures, all with onset in the right temporal lobe. No secondary generalization observed.
- Neuropsychological Assessment: Mild impairment in visual memory consistent with right temporal dysfunction.
- PET Scan (2023): Hypometabolism localized to the right temporal lobe, further supporting focal epilepsy diagnosis.

Post-surgical Investigations:
- MRI (2024): Post-resection changes in the right anterior temporal lobe without evidence of residual or new pathology.
- EEG (2024): Normal background activity without epileptiform discharges.

Clinical Assessment:
Ms. Watson was seen in the epilepsy clinic today for her routine post-surgical follow-up. She reports no seizures or auras since her surgery. She has experienced no medication side effects and feels well overall. She has returned to part-time work, and her sleep quality and mood are good. She denies symptoms of anxiety or depression.

Neurological examination was unremarkable, with no focal deficits. Cognitive testing in clinic revealed no changes in memory or attention since the pre-surgical neuropsychological assessment. Physical examination, including gait and coordination, was normal.

Discussion and Plan:
I congratulated Ms. Watson on her excellent post-surgical outcome and discussed the importance of maintaining her current treatment regimen. She was counseled on the ongoing, albeit reduced, risk of seizure recurrence even after successful surgery. The following key points were emphasized:
1. Long-term continuation of lacosamide to minimize the risk of recurrence.
2. Lifestyle modifications, including adequate sleep, regular meals, stress management, and avoiding known triggers such as excessive alcohol.
3. The rare but serious risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is significantly lower given her seizure freedom.

We discussed her prognosis, including the likelihood of sustained seizure freedom and potential medication tapering in the distant future if seizure freedom persists. I emphasized the need for close monitoring before any changes are made to her treatment.

Follow-up Plan:
- Routine follow-up in 6 months, or sooner if symptoms recur or if she has questions.
- Referral to neuropsychology for repeat cognitive testing in 2025 to assess long-term memory outcomes post-surgery.
- Driving reinstatement assessment in January 2025 after meeting the seizure-free guidelines.

Ms. Watson expressed her satisfaction with her care and stated she feels optimistic about her quality of life moving forward. She understands she can contact the clinic if needed.
